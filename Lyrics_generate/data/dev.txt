There is a place ñ Reserved ñ For me and my friends ñ And when we go ñ We all will go ñ So you see ñ I'm never alone ñ There is a place ñ With a bit more time ñ And a few more ñ Gentler words ñ And looking back ñ We do forgive ñ (we had no choice ñ We always did) ñ All that we hope ñ Is that when we go ñ Our skin ñ And our blood ñ And our bones ñ Don't get in your way ñ Making you ill ñ The way they did ñ When we lived ñ There is a place ñ A place in hell ñ Reserved ñ For me and my friends ñ And if ever I ñ Wanted to cry ñ Then I will ñ Because I can
(Coming round my house again) ñ You watched me dance from right to left ñ You watched me dance from left to right ñ And every time I learned the steps ñ You changed them overnight ñ Every twist every turn ñ Every waltz I danced alone ñ Now the steps are old and worn ñ You watched me dance ñ (It's the art, and it's the entertainment of certain groups of working populations and it has a history and it has roots and it's gone for donkey's years)
Goodnight, sweetheart, well, it's time to go ñ Goodnight, sweetheart, well, it's time to go ñ We hate to leave you, but we really must say ñ Goodnight, sweetheart, goodnight ñ Goodnight, sweetheart, well, it's time to go ñ Goodnight, sweetheart, well, it's time to go ñ We hate to leave you, but we really must say ñ Goodnight, sweetheart, goodnight
Of Him who is able to keep you from falling ñ And present you unstained at His glorious throne ñ To Jesus our Savior ñ Be glory and majesty, power and honor ñ To Jesus alone ñ He's mercy and truth and His love everlasting ñ Tomorrow and yesterday, ever the same ñ Throughout all the ages, today and forever ñ Let earth and the heavens sing praise to the name ñ Repeat all above three and a half times

Every time you love just a little ñ Take one step closer, solving a riddle ñ It echoes all over the world ñ Every time you opt in to kindness ñ Make one connection, used to divide us ñ It echoes all over the world ñ Every time you choose one more morning ñ Goodness or meanness, life has one warning ñ It echoes all over the world ñ When a leader gets the hungry fed food ñ When you just make love inside your bedroom ñ It echoes all over the world
You walk to the trash can ñ And throw out the soup ñ Your mind is waiting ñ 'cause there's so much to do ñ Johnny gave you a postcard ñ To write it all down ñ Why are you so stuck, kid ñ Look up from the ground ñ  ñ Come over to my place ñ I'll help find your fix ñ You've got lots of potential ñ Can you feel it ñ Your dad saw you crying ñ When you looked at the world ñ Sit and stare at your hands ñ 'cause there's so much to lose ñ  ñ Crawl into the birdcage ñ Become a cartoon ñ 'cause all of the flowers ñ Are too much for you
We finished our old lives (Yeah!) ñ Like we finished off the wine (Yeah!) ñ Now we're used to staying up all night (Yeah!) ñ Two hearts beating ñ Oh yeah, oh yeah ñ  ñ Well you can keep tomorrow ñ After tonight we're not gonna need it ñ Beat up!

Under conquered skies ñ Once thought holy, now have died ñ Uprising heresy ñ Impious reign of destiny ñ Reign down unwanted crown ñ Possess ñ Unholy ground ñ Guide into climactic times ñ Incarnate ñ Ways prevail ñ Uprising heresy ñ Under conquered skies ñ Once thought holy, now have died ñ Uprising heresy ñ Impious reign of destiny ñ Days and age of wrath ñ Empowering ñ Forsaken will ñ This legend of the past

You have stripped my heart of all it's parts ñ And gave away the scrap for free ñ You have sold your soul for some control ñ And gnawed at the hands that tried to love and feed ñ You are crying out to end the drought ñ Yet it's not your blood that filled this sea ñ All of the mistakes left in your wake ñ They all remind me of a younger me ñ To the parasites that have come and gone ñ This is your farewell song ñ To the parasites that have come and gone ñ This is your farewell song ñ Run, just run away
Conscience drifting towards the darkness and the light ñ The thoughts attack me ñ Won't let me sleep ñ When will I rest in peace? ñ Closed off ñ I never did their crimes ñ Still I'm living with a guilty conscience ñ I never did their crimes ñ So why am I still burning inside? ñ I never did their crimes ñ My thoughts eating me alive ñ Closed off ñ I never did their crimes ñ Still I'm living with a guilty conscience ñ The thoughts attack me ñ Still I'm guilty ñ I never did their crimes ñ Still I'm guilty
I wanted what I can't have ñ If I forget, help me to stand ñ The rest of our days will be there ñ I wanted, so I pretend ñ Pull down the voices in your head ñ The rest of our days will be there ñ My body's awake and alive ñ My mind is afraid to fight ñ I wanted what I can't have ñ The rest of our days will be there
When the mornin' comes and I feel a little heartache ñ When the mornin' comes ñ I'll hold my breath, get my game-face on ñ And face the world, life goes on ñ It's a change of reason, a bad time of the season ñ A-take a good look around ñ For that time and place, yeah I've made mistakes ñ But as far as we go we'll move on ñ That's the way I am, I can take it with a grin ñ That's a good place to start ñ I recognize the things, all the things I've missed ñ That's another story for another time ñ Life goes on
Pretty girl, don't you waste a word ñ For I can't love you, Not ever ñ Take this afternoon, recall our sexual mood ñ But, I'm not loving you, not ever ñ Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ñ See that southern sky, drifting past the lights ñ It won't touch you or I, not ever ñ Ooh, yeah, ooh, ooh
If you find yourself here ñ On my side of town ñ I pray that you'd come to my door ñ And talk to me like you don't know ñ What we ever fought about ñ 'Cause I don't remember anymore ñ I just know that she warms my heart ñ And knows what all my imperfections are ñ And she said that I was the brightest little firefly in her jar ñ And I just know that she warms my heart ñ And knows what all my imperfections are ñ And she said that I was the brightest little firefly in her jar
Fools rush in ñ Where angels fear to tread ñ And so I come to you my love ñ My heart above my head ñ Though I see ñ The danger there ñ If there's a chance for me ñ Then I don't care ñ Fools rush in ñ Where wise men never go ñ But wise men never fall in love ñ So how are they to know ñ When we met ñ I felt my life begin ñ So open up your heart and let ñ This fool rush in
As I sit here ñ Wishing for something else ñ Writhing hurting ñ Horrid jerking ñ Motion breeds love ñ Lost in its innocence ñ Hoping lurking ñ Constant flirting ñ I took the strychnine ñ Blood in the snow ñ Slit by slit and ñ Blow by blow ñ I took the strychnine ñ Turned into a slut ñ Stich by stich and ñ Cut by cut ñ I wish you could be ñ I wish you could be ñ I wish you could be ñ More than you will be ñ She crushed me with a look ñ She crushed me with a look ñ She crushed me with a look ñ She crushed me with a look
I behold Your power and glory ñ Bring an offering ñ Come before You ñ Worship You Lord ñ In the beauty of Your holiness ñ Whenever I call You're there ñ Redeemer and friend ñ Cherished beyond all words ñ This love never ends ñ Morning by morning ñ Your mercy awakens my soul ñ I lift up my eyes to see ñ The wonders of heaven ñ Opening over me ñ Your goodness abound ñ You've taken my breath away ñ With Your irresistible love
Camilla Horne, she was born a long, long time ago ñ She Came From Germany to the U.S.A ñ And was acclaimed as the next Garbo ñ They came to her on their knees, to bless them, caress them and ñ Tell them what they need ñ But oh, oh, she did not know ñ And so she took her place at the bar ñ Just another fallen star
Cynical, it's just your way ñ You play the doubting Thomas ñ Feel the scars and wipe the stains ñ So you fight, and retreat ñ And talk yourself out of believing ñ In any peace that you can't see ñ Blind words you call ñ Blind words will fall ñ You're logical, you can't find ñ Any reason to believe in love, you are blind ñ Crucify, and deny ñ Pass the blame and burn the mission ñ Till dust remains and wash your hands ñ Blind words you call ñ Blind words will fall ñ Blind words you call ñ Blind words will fall
Couldn't you let it lie? ñ With a smile and subterfuge ñ You dance your savage dance ñ Some hidden cause you cannot justify ñ A lie's a lie ñ Couldn't you let it lie? ñ Couldn't you let it lie? ñ Conscience clear and sanctified ñ You wash your sins away ñ In God's name you start your holy war ñ Who's it for? ñ Couldn't you let it lie? ñ Couldn't you let it lie? ñ Couldn't you let it lie? ñ Couldn't you let it lie? ñ Couldn't you let it lie? ñ Couldn't you let it lie? ñ Couldn't you let it lie?

The first thousand miles ñ On ambition stale ñ The world of diamond smiles ñ And a spotlight glare ñ And no one asks where you came from ñ Or where you're going to ñ  ñ The next ten thousand miles ñ Becomes a race ñ And the body was never tired ñ Of the hands you have to shake ñ And no one asks where you came from ñ Or where you're going to ñ  ñ When every seed is sown and battles won ñ All this froth and foam or is the best yet to come ñ And no one asks where you came from ñ Or where are you going to
No one could care in this room if I died ñ If I died right in front of your eyes ñ I'd maybe get a second chance or a smile ñ Don't defame with little games ñ The secret ways of Elohim ñ To walk transparent is an order ñ In L.A. - 1989 ñ But why me? ñ Why me? ñ When in distress ñ Don't test the spirits of the air ñ Or the comforter who guideth mine and I ñ You may not get a second chance or a smile ñ It's like the drums keep breating rhythms to my brain ñ Why me?
If I can be your clothes ñ I'll hang off all your bones ñ Every hour ñ Every day (x7)
There is no escape ñ This is your punishment ñ I have been waiting for your arrival ñ Noone will save you now ñ They cannot save themselves ñ This place awaits them to harbor their flesh forever ñ As you suffer ñ Become a part ñ Of the landscapes made of human skin ñ Fields of conquered flesh ñ In which you will descend ñ Yearning for a release that will never come ñ As you suffer ñ Become a part ñ Of the landscape made of human skin ñ One thousand... ways to bleed ñ One thousand... ways to burn

A broken down melody ñ The saddest music in the world ñ In a haunted dancehall ñ The ghosts are still trying ñ To make sense of it all ñ I can dream can't I? ñ I can dream can't I? ñ They brought me a white tunic ñ They've drawn cool pearls ñ Echelon ñ I am pleased that they should do these things ñ Another world ñ These days of dissonance ñ This age of rage ñ A broken down melody ñ The saddest music in the world ñ Another world ñ Un autre monde ñ In a haunted dancehall ñ In a haunted dancehall
Yo, let me tell you how i care, when i was locked up, I couldn't smell the piss only the scent of your hair ñ So why you acting so scared ñ Yo Carmen wait let me finish, Cause you acting bout as bitter as a  ñ That sounds good and everything but the top of you changed
Just let go ñ Run ñ They are whispering ñ Never surrender. Never give in ñ In flashes of lightning ñ You will shine ñ Do as you want ñ Do what you want

Six months of slumplife ñ Snuck up on winter ñ We had face masks and costumes ñ We grew expressionless with time ñ Six months of slumplife ñ Were interrupted ñ When school kids prised tired eyes ñ Open at home time ñ We write our names down ñ Just to prove that we're alive ñ Ohh, ahh, la la la! ñ Six months of slumplife ñ Turn bones to splinters ñ Mother, I'm steering fine ñ With daggers in my tyres ñ We walked the straight line ñ We walked the straight line ñ Just to prove that we can try

She wore blue velvet ñ Bluer than velvet was the night ñ Softer than satin was the light ñ From the stars ñ She wore blue velvet ñ Bluer than velvet were her eyes ñ Warmer than May her tender sighs ñ Love was ours ñ Ours a love I held tightly ñ Feeling the rapture grow ñ Like a flame burning brightly ñ But when she left, gone was the glow of ñ Blue velvet ñ But in my heart there'll always be ñ Precious and warm, a memory ñ Through the years ñ And I still can see blue velvet ñ Through my tears
Our lady of more (Repeat) ñ Our lady of more, this saddened whore ñ How I adore her, when she's on the floor ñ Lonely love is blind to ashes ñ Lonely love is blind ñ Lonely love is blind to ashes ñ Lonely love unwinds ñ She's like the twilight, their needle sings (?) ñ Skin of the mayflower, a pale reflection brings
Right from the start ñ You were a thief you stole my heart ñ And I your willing victim ñ I let you see the parts of me ñ That weren't all that pretty ñ And with every touch you fixed them ñ Now you've been talking in your sleep ñ Oh, oh ñ Things you never say to me ñ Oh, oh ñ Tell me that you've had enough ñ Of our love, our love
And everything I come from the sky ñ I break down and cry ñ I'd realize, she's out of my life ñ Oh baby ñ There goes that feeling all over again ñ In such place of feeling I won't let you in ñ Girl, I don't wanna be in this world all alone by myself ñ No one knows that you're in
Congratulations, you're a fucking clone ñ You all look the same to me and it doesn't look good ñ I don't think you're pretty, i don't think you're cute ñ When you open your mouth i want to put you on mute ñ Starvation and diets are what you condone ñ Tanning salons are your second home ñ A pound of make-up to hide your ugly face ñ A strain on my eyes, a human disgrace ñ Ugly on the inside makes you ugly on the outside ñ The truth is... ñ You'd look better hacked to chunks in a dumpster ñ Better off dead
You're like a lover ñ In that when you look you make lists ñ I could do with more of that ñ More of that ñ Less of this ñ Shine your light ñ I don't mind ñ Shine your light ñ I don't mind ñ You know what words of love ñ Get squeezed out ñ By a hand tightening 'round your neck ñ Tell me love ñ Tell me it ñ Hold me tight ñ I don't mind ñ Hold me tight ñ I don't mind
My baby don't care for shows ñ My baby don't care for clothes ñ My baby just cares for me ñ My baby don't care for furs and laces ñ My baby don't care for high toned places ñ My baby don't care for rings ñ Or other expensive things ñ She's sensible as can be ñ My baby don't care who knows it ñ My baby just cares for me
Me and the boy with the aubergine hair ñ Travel the world with only three cares ñ One is of money, and two is of time ñ Three is the tragedy that you are not mine ñ Sundays, all of my demons rest ñ But today's not a Sunday ñ Sundays, all of my demons rest ñ Rest, rest, rest, rest, rest
(Instrumental) ñ "The sound of thousand warriors ñ The fields of thousand battles ñ Still, in our hearts we can hear ñ The great hymn of Karelia."

Love, I'll never marry you ñ Because you don't ever tell the truth ñ Love, you come and then you go ñ Love, I'll need a little more ñ Love, I see no heart in you ñ You, you play me for a fool ñ Love, you come and tie me down ñ You go, and you leave me on the ground ñ In you I drown ñ Love, your presence burns the eyes ñ Love, your leaving tells the lies, and that's why ñ Love, I'll never marry you ñ Love, I'll never marry you ñ Love, I'll never marry you ñ Love, I'll never marry you
As I walk through this world ñ Nothing can stop the Duke of Earl ñ And if you follow me faithfully ñ I will promise you peace in heaven above ñ I tell you nothing can stop me ñ Oh no yeah baby ñ Yes I m the Duke of Earl ñ Now do not question and do not think ñ Just follow blindly and listen to me ñ Cause I will lead you to a promise land ñ If you have faith and take my hand ñ WHO'S AN INDIVIDUAL?
UglyDolls ñ I'll crush them all, destroy their dream ñ To save my perfect empire, nothing's too extreme ñ And I know how to do it without looking too uncouth ñ Plan it so foul, gross, hideous, nasty ñ And then I see the ugly truth
Walking into open space ñ Walking into open space ñ Do you, do you, do you know? ñ Is the truth you see left celluloid? ñ Is the truth you see left celluloid?
Sorry it's been a while Simbi ñ She's been exposed to quite a lot ñ Those trails and persons are something that you'll have to experience ñ I think this could become your reality ñ I think you belong here
So quiet I can't define ñ What's swimming inside my mind ñ I've been here before my darling ñ No worries when I'm with you ñ No raindrops within my view ñ I've been here before my darling ñ  ñ And now that you're mine ñ I'll be there on time ñ You'll be on my mind ñ  ñ Still dancing with my sweetest heart ñ Romancing in a distant park ñ We've been here before my darling ñ  ñ And now that you're mine ñ I'll be there on time ñ You'll be on my mind
Man or Machine ñ What have you been ñ What are you now ñ Log in, log out ñ Man or machine ñ What are your dreams ñ How can you die ñ Future is a lie ñ Man or Machine ñ An empty race ñ No body or soul ñ This machinery's ñ Got control ñ Man or machine ñ What have you been ñ What are you now ñ System's down ñ Man or machine ñ How can't you see ñ You are nothing to me ñ You are nothing to me ñ Man or Machine
You are the promised kiss of springtime ñ That makes the lonely winter seem long ñ You are the breathless hush of evening ñ That trembles on the brink of a lovely song ñ You are the angel glow, that light's a star ñ The dearest thing's I know, are what you are ñ Someday my happy arms will hold you ñ And someday I'll know that moment divine ñ When all the things you are, are mine
It's wonderful to be ñ Just living in a dream ñ Far from (the) reality ñ Illusion to be lived ñ Like freedom in your soul ñ Like freedom in your heart ñ Like freedom in your life ñ Welcome to paradise ñ A place where we belong ñ A place where we wold live ñ No matter how we feel ñ Far from (the) reality ñ Illusion to be lived ñ Like freedom in your soul ñ Like freedom in your heart ñ Welcome to paradise ñ A place where we belong ñ No wonder when we meet ñ An angel
In my head, I feel so bad, because I didn't go to bed ñ - Don't be a baby, you might feel bad now, but we just wanna dance, is that a crime?
Lover, one lovely day ñ Love came planning to stay ñ Green dolphin street supplied the setting ñ A setting for nights beyond forgetting ñ Through these moments apart ñ Memories live in my heart ñ When I recall the love I found on ñ I could kiss the ground on ñ Green dolphin street
Uhh, that was creepy ñ I would rather slurp rancid tuna salad out of my own ass ñ Or scour my boobies off with a rusty S O S pad ñ Or hump a piece of splintered balsa wood
There we were ñ Movingly deciding ñ Where to go ñ Let me speak my soul ñ We should learn ñ A plan to rise above ñ Tables turn ñ Heaven knows you're wrong ñ Wonder why ñ Your eyes disguise ñ Nice yet vile ñ I've seen the sign ñ When you skip the blues ñ You lose ñ My rules on you ñ To get used get through
Jesus bleibt meine freud ñ Jesus bleibet meine Freude ñ Meines meines herzens Trost und Saft ñ Where did you come from ñ Where did you go ñ Where did you come from Cotton-eyed Joe? ñ Well I come for to see you come for to sing ñ Come for to show you ñ A diamond ring
I feel like I've met you before ñ You're just too easy to adore ñ You sing just like the whispering, moaning  ñ  ñ My, oh my, you look just like an angel does ñ What will this do to me? ñ I'm not too scared to see my heart break ñ  ñ 'Cause I know it'll be romantic ñ 'Cause I know it'll be romantic ñ  ñ 'Cause it's all for love ñ For love
So fine, so fine, so fine, yeah ñ My baby's so doggone fine ñ And she loves me, come rain, come shine ñ Woh-oh, yeah, so fine ñ She thrills me, she thrills me, she thrills me, yeah ñ My baby thrills me all the time ñ She sends cold chills up and down my spine ñ Woh-oh, yeah, so fine ñ Well, I know, I know she loves me so ñ Well, I know, I know because my baby tells me so-woh-woh ñ So fine, so fine, so fine, yeah ñ My baby's so doggone fine ñ She sends cold chills up and down my spine ñ Woh-oh, yeah, so fine
Through this pain I refine ñ Tearing me from within ñ Screaming to be released but held fast by Your love ñ Hold me here ñ Break me until my face breathes upon this ground ñ Outstretched with my head to the floor ñ Spent of all my strength ñ Relying on Yours
Caught in the undertow, down I go, deep dark below ñ Hold my breath, fight to find, anything ñ Some sort of lifeline ñ  ñ Sunk ñ Can I find my way? ñ To the surface ñ Would pay ñ Anything to get new life ñ Lift me up from this compromise ñ  ñ Silence - I want to scream out, water fills my lungs ñ I want to get it out but it's just begun ñ I can't breathe ñ I want to leave ñ Oh, I need you to save me now ñ Upside down, turn around, aqua-bound, swim to the ground ñ Endless war, ocean floor, needing more ñ Any way I'm done for
You won't have another chance ñ Come now and join our dance ñ (Don't cry tonight, I live my live) ñ One more night together ñ No more wasted time ñ In your arms forever ñ For the rest of my life ñ In your eyes a wonder ñ Waiting to be found ñ I'll keep dreaming our love ñ Until the end of my time
Unseen eyes watch ñ Closer I become one ñ I follow them down ñ Riding the winds of the forgotten ñ The phantom in your heart ñ I am the hidden wisdom ñ The unconscious universe ñ Frozen in darkness ñ Lead me to this place where the dead ñ Cry and sing ñ In the image of the beast I roam ñ Devoured by the earth and all it's ñ Vengeance ñ Inside this mortal frame ñ I ascend in the eternal ñ Appease the wraith of the dead ñ I walk among the lifeless ñ So few stands in the hour glass ñ Slipping so fast away ñ I ascend in the eternal
Another day, another night ñ I spent my life not thinking about you ñ Another birth, another life ñ Another world where nobody breathes your name ñ Another day, another night ñ Another lifetime thinking about you ñ See every mark, turn on a light ñ I tell some summer's weathered my face but ñ I forget about the trouble you might have been in ñ I'm here, still shedding the same skin ñ Still shedding the same skin
Used to be a dreamer ñ But you know I've found ñ A better way - you ñ Thought I was a loser ñ But you proved me wrong ñ You're taking me so much higher ñ You're taking me so much higher ñ Higher and higher ñ Girl, you're taking me so much higher ñ You're taking me so much higher ñ You're taking me so much higher ñ You're taking me so much higher
Somebodys Father, Somebodys Father, Somebodys Father, Somebodys Father
How can we enjoy ñ The flavor in our mouths ñ When already we're dreaming ñ Of the taste of the next bite?
It's not so easy getting up so early every day so much responsibility ñ In the morning when my eyes are falling out my head I look at him and he starts my engines ñ That kid is rocket fuel (please please go to sleep) ñ When I fall asleep thats his cue to start screaming wanna pull my hair out ñ He said "da da" yesterday and make it all worth it ñ I looked at him and couldn't help but grin
Big hands, hold on to your machine ñ In the eyes of the factory you've got a life ñ In the grinding and stamping and twisting and molding and bolting ñ Big hands, hold up your tiny home ñ They're razing the city ñ You can go to the plaza and visit your kids ñ Big hands, hold out your empty palms ñ Submit and surrender ñ You've got nothing to show and nothing to give
Morning bright, rise, go over your lines ñ Iron your carefully crafted disguise ñ We'd all like to sing, it's easy to sigh ñ To sprinkle a handful of plausible lies ñ Our buildings will rise, poke out our own eyes ñ Publicly smile and privately frown ñ A weeping reprise, please hear my cries ñ I'd like to pull just this one building down ñ So turn off the sky, head in my hands ñ Night keep me warm, white windowsill ñ Blinded by heart, cut my hair short ñ "Eyeless in Gaza with the slaves at the mill"
He comes one day ñ Remember ñ He comes again ñ Nobody ever knows the time ñ Noone knows the place ñ He came to our fathers ñ Many times before ñ He promissed to come again ñ So everybody could know ñ He comes one day ñ Remember ñ He comes again ñ Watch out! ñ He's comming your way ñ Don't let him down ñ He's the real one
I'm gonna love you like nobody's loved you ñ Come rain or come shine ñ High as a mountain an' deep as a river ñ Come rain or come shine ñ Guess when you met me ñ It was just one of those things ñ But don't ever bet me ñ 'Cause I'm gonna be true if you let me ñ You're gonna love me like nobody's loved me ñ Come rain or come shine ñ Happy together, unhappy together ñ Ah, won't it be fine? ñ Days may be cloudy or sunny ñ We're in or we're out of the money ñ I'm with you always ñ I'm with you rain or shine
For crying out loud ñ You got the right to say who you are ñ Oh, you are a true god, full of power ñ Believe in me tonight ñ You got the right ñ Gotta be no violence ñ I know what's right ñ I'm not blind
It's feeding my mind ñ Killing time on my hands ñ It's eating my mind ñ Finding a place to lash out once again ñ I can't shake the feeling ñ That is burning through my veins ñ Slam the gates and lock all the doors ñ And I won't let nobody in ñ It's drinking my blood ñ Racing straight to my brain ñ Talking right through me man ñ Fuckin feeling good ñ Right now I feel like shit ñ This fiend is taking over ñ And demanding all control ñ I've got to make a stand ñ Before it crucifies my soul ñ Fiend, Fiend, Fiend...
Sammy Jammy on the track ñ Mainstream rappers are really sack ñ Bounce to the beat of this drum ñ Bum bum buuuum ñ Sammy Jammy on the hook ñ My names not Sandy but I shoot with my cook ñ My track is fire no wonder I'm big ñ I will snap you like a twig ñ Sammy Jammy boom bam click ñ I will explode ya house real quick ñ Boom shake slam I am the man ñ Eat your beans out the can ñ Argh Matty I'm off the track ñ New Yorks rappers is really wack
Once, there was a jolly roar. In every {?], in every home ñ Ahmed bit sanders, an ocean of wanders under the red marquise ñ Untill they found you, with blood all around you ñ And the guilty old hands were these ñ I Love The Avenue ñ Once on a summernight ñ I tore your heart into
I'm not that kind of fool ñ Who needs to read the room ñ (Somebody tell me) ñ If I've fallen from your lips ñ Straight to your fingertips ñ (Somebody tell me) ñ  ñ Now you're waiting in the light ñ Patiently to my surprise ñ (Somebody tell me) ñ I pick up the superbike ñ Going 80 in the night ñ (Somebody tell me) ñ Said you wanted something else ñ Something new for show and tell ñ Gonna breathe until you're gone ñ Gonna breathe until you're
It's no secret ñ That I feel the pain of everyone ñ But it only sweetens me...
Just follow me ñ And you will see ñ What folks in Harlem ñ Call Trickeration ñ Don't mean a thing ñ This crazy swing ñ Latest thing in Harlem ñ Trickeration! ñ Rhythm, look what you went and done ñ Rhythm, you are the guilty one ñ Another phrase ñ Just another craze ñ Everyone in Harlem ñ Does Trickeration
Love laughs at a king ñ Kings don't mean a thing ñ On the street of dreams ñ Dreams broken in two ñ Can be made like new ñ On the street of dreams ñ Gold, silver and gold ñ All you can hold's up there on a moonbeam ñ For there ain't nobody poor, long as love is sure ñ On the street of dreams ñ All the gold, silver and gold ñ All you can hold's up there on a moonbeam ñ For nobody's poor, long as love is sure ñ On the street of dreams
Habit rules the ñ Hearts of all men ñ Confining force ñ Past to future ñ Nothing as sure ñ As a man's heart ñ Bound in his ways ñ Slavery ñ Wandering the tracks ñ Of blind custom ñ Men are not free ñ Enslaved ñ Part of the herd ñ Bleating its song ñ Bound by the past ñ All futures set ñ Cast off the chains that confine ñ Set free of custom that binds ñ To be reborn one must pledge ñ Murder of who one once was ñ Part of the herd ñ To be reborn we must ñ Bleating its song ñ Pledge to murder ourselves
You told me that I'm a paranoiac ñ 'cos I'm a person who lives on stressing joints ñ 'cos there's nothing I love in this f*ckin' world ñ So you told that my brain is psychologically insane... ñ Open your ears f*ckin' asshole ñ I'd rather choose the way of an insane paranoiac ñ Than follow a plastic society again and again... ñ MY HATE AGAINST CONFORMITY IS AN UNAFFECTED FEELING!! ñ I'd rather choose the way of an insane paranoiac... ñ I'd rather choose the way of an insane paranoiac...
Every moment in every second ñ Every day that I'm awake ñ Every chance that I get ñ I am frozen in regret ñ Every day shows signs of rust ñ And I watch the sky turn gray ñ I am frozen ñ Every moment in every second ñ Every step that I take ñ I am frozen by these things ñ I find another way to burn my soul again ñ And I watch the days go by ñ I am frozen every time I return to burn ñ Every time I return to burn
On the Merry-go-round ñ We'll go merrily round and around ñ Round and around up to heaven and down ñ Round and around up to heaven and sound ñ Magical sound of the merry-go-round ñ Oh! We'll be so happy just you and I ñ Happy ever after--never a care as around we fly ñ Hearts so full of laughter--on the merry-go-round ñ We'll go merrily round and around ñ Round and around up to heaven and down
This life, it will destroy your heart ñ Life will only rip us apart ñ Let me reach inside my flesh to show you my pain ñ The hurt and the ugliness remains the same ñ Life can you make you meaningless and cold ñ Life, darkness a feeling I know ñ I tried to be perfect the outcome is death ñ The love and the beauty take my last breath ñ I killed myself one thousand times seeking light ñ Just to remember your face when I die
Darling ñ I can see it's a calamity you've been through ñ And maybe we're too old just to say that you ñ You can see that your timing and intention ñ Yeah, it's just my suspicion

White faced ghoul ñ Full moon bright ñ The dead dance here ñ With me tonight ñ Rising now, dead no more ñ I scratched your name on the coffin door ñ Stuck inside of my head ñ Oh nothin' here seems right ñ In the graveyard of love ñ I'm a corpse tonight ñ I try to rise up ñ And live again ñ A zombie in this haze ñ Howlin' 'til the end ñ Do the hot tears flow ñ On a warm summer's night ñ Does that permanent smile ñ On your wrist feel right ñ With a black cat's howl ñ And your own screams ñ Oh why is nothin' ñ Ever what it seems
As we made our exit ñ Through the door ñ Into the outside ñ And shedding off the voices ñ Of those who ñ Are beat out by the background ñ Music lingers far beyond ñ Of those left over ñ And going on ñ About their long days ñ About their long days ñ Changing with the seasons ñ And Loraine ñ Looking in the rear view ñ Someday California ñ On your dime ñ And I'll see it before you ñ Good luck next time ñ I'll see you around ñ Ain't it like me to let you down ñ On a long day ñ On a long day ñ Such a long day ñ Such a long day ñ Such a long day
The bulldozer need to push something over ñ If I were a house ñ The state would've condemned me ñ Beware of god ñ Beware of god ñ Beware of god
I am someone else ñ Not forever, no ñ Come rescue me from my mama ñ Someone like you, not me ñ Someone who flies too close ñ The moon, the ground ñ I want to know ñ You know how people are ñ You tell them something ñ And they start talking ñ You stare an abyss ñ And the abyss stares back at ñ You, you ñ You, you
So, once again ignored ñ Awkward moments feeling low ñ I want to end it, I hate it, I hate this shit ñ But you won't approach it ñ I hope you can grow so I can go ñ What's the point of finishing? ñ Is all this shit diminishing?
I push my Z-28 down I-85 ñ I got a day to see my baby it's a two day drive ñ Hey hey Mr. DJ ñ I got a coffee and a rocket workin overtime ñ And I'm countin on you, man to keep me alive ñ Hey hey Mr. DJ ñ Hey hey Mr. DJ won't you play for me all night long ñ Hey hey Mr. DJ play it all night long ñ I've been drivin all night, got the radio on ñ Oh I'm countin on you to keep me goin ñ Hey hey Mr. DJ ñ Play me some rock&roll music and I'll turn it up ñ Play me some rock&roll music I can never get enough ñ Hey hey Mr. DJ
Malanga, ta pillao ñ Malanga, alborotao ñ Malanga, cada cual con su caiman ñ Malanga, ta voltiao ñ Eh eh eh eh ah ñ Malanga, ta trancao ñ Malanga, y despeinao ñ Malanga, with this song and with this phrase ñ Malanga, arrinconao ñ Eh eh eh eh ah
Chapter February 2003 - Interim ñ This song is an instrumental
Have you got any magic tricks ñ That will work for me? ñ 'cause my baby is in the ground ñ And she won't come back now ñ The lights in the sky are practically blue hot white ñ The light in my eye is so sharp it cuts the blue right out ñ Have you got any magic tricks that will work for me? ñ I don't suppose there's anything at all in that bag of yours for me ñ 'cause my baby is in the ground ñ And she's not coming back now
Pink sky, pink drink ñ The world is wonderful ñ Pink sky, pink drink ñ I didn't do it on purpose ñ Slit my wrists, throw away my soul ñ You know me too well ñ Black heart, dark mind ñ Tried to down the whole bottle ñ We could've been angels in the fog ñ You could've kept going until we passed out ñ To imitate you is a fucking joke to me, to me ñ We could've been angels in the fog ñ We could've kept going until we passed out ñ Couldn't wait until I got home, got home ñ Never getting home
Once I was very brave ñ I stepped on that stage ñ It took my breath away ñ Nerves caught around my neck ñ I cried out for help ñ No one was there ñ My words turned into ash ñ They went nowhere ñ As if I'm barely there ñ Collect my troubles ñ Spit out when I'm told ñ Repeat it and ñ I'll take what's left of ñ My strength and get on ñ My feet again ñ On the tip of my tongue ñ I breathe again ñ I bury my stutter ñ On the tip of my tongue ñ I breathe again ñ I bury my stutter
On Phil's Farm the action's slow ñ We sit and watch the tractors go ñ Day and Night ñ Night and Day ñ We don't shower ñ We don't shave ñ We all live like Kings ñ But all eat like pigs ñ We laugh, we joke ñ We Drink we Smoke ñ It's the music that Phil digs

The saddest brown eyes ñ I'll ever know ñ You gave up crying ñ So long ago ñ But come outside ñ And watch the snow ñ Softly falling ñ  ñ Sad little moon in the big black sky ñ All alone, hang your head and cry ñ Sad little moon in the timeless night ñ You may sleep, but you will never die ñ  ñ You didn't need them ñ Your Sunday friends ñ And so you watched them ñ Like grains of sand ñ Running one by one ñ Out of your hands ñ Softly falling
Drunk on the venom from the mouths of snakes ñ The taste was bitter ñ It broke me down ñ It stained my insides with the mark of Cain ñ My own mother won't say my name ñ Raised by the wind and freezing rain ñ The gates of heaven have shut again ñ A perfect little worm feasting on dirt ñ A good life wasted longing for pain ñ Hidden in the dark watching lovers weep ñ Every heart will break and never heal again ñ I stand alone watching a perfect little worm as it feeds on dirt
Watching, waiting for a question worth asking to come to mind ñ It's nothing I can't handle from the inside ñ It's not the words you're saying but the way you open and close your mouth ñ It's not like last year ñ It doesn't have the magic of the words said at the last go-round ñ When their eyes were all open at the same time ñ Open wide ñ Why don't you sit down for a moment ñ And let me say something that just might change your whole mind
Laughing, stranding, standing ñ 'Cos our life is just a trampoline ñ Got no sunshine rise on a despair ñ Laughing, stranding, standing ñ 'Cos our life is like a submarine ñ Even sunshine reach into deep ends ñ **Got to see ñ Got to feel inside I'm all alone ñ And standing in the storm ñ ***Day after day ñ The ghost's watching you ñ Day after day ñ Souls that you lose ñ Day after day ñ The ghost's watching you ñ Day after day ñ *Repete ñ **Repete ñ ***Repete ñ **Repete ñ ***Repete...
I don't believe your innocence ñ You're hiding lies behind distant lips ñ No emotion just unimpatient words ñ Which brings you romance you don't deserve ñ Shallow breathing and heavy eyes ñ Another day, a new disguise ñ Looking ahead through tomorrows rains ñ I've seen your face you'll never change ñ Every question makes no fucking sense ñ Every answer reminds me why I fucking quit ñ Don't act like you don't understand ñ Your act is done
Fed up with myself ñ Staying inside ñ Why bother getting up ñ Cold hard words ñ Meaningless words ñ On just how much a life is worth ñ I submit to live a life feeling left over ñ I submit to live a life where i have nothing ñ Lets blame the mailman ñ We are numbers ñ On your frame ñ The voices in the other end ñ Who would care ñ When i give up ñ As the gold keeps comming in ñ I submit to live a life feeling left over ñ I submit to live a life where i have nothing
Waste away till you're all used up ñ Walk away till you lose your touch ñ But someone won't be there anymore ñ Lost again in the same old muss ñ I remember how it was once ñ But memories don't do me any good ñ Oh ñ Oh I just can't take it anymore ñ Let it come get the best of us ñ Letting go 'cause it takes too much ñ Until they can't take us anymore ñ Tumble down and all broken up ñ I remember how it was once ñ But memories aren't doing any good ñ Oh ñ Oh I just can't take it anymore ñ Oh
There is an arsenal ñ And it is possible ñ To dim the lights some more ñ And hide it from our eyes ñ There is a path to blaze ñ That curves both right and left ñ Looked down and saw the ground ñ Looked round and cut the trees ñ Looked up and saw the sky ñ Launched a mission in disguise ñ There is a shining sky ñ And it is possible ñ To run the race on earth ñ To patch the wounded ground ñ There is a path to blaze ñ The right path is what is left
You wonder why crime's on the rise. Kids are willing to compromise their ñ Futures by getting high. And you still don't realize You taught them... ñ It was you You taught them to waste their lives

And I can't do it ñ These songs stuck in my head ñ Most of which I don't regret ñ And I can't compete ñ With those beats inside a chest ñ Whose tempos match all the rest ñ And I can't deny ñ Simplify or lie ñ Their influence in those green eyes
Don't you want me? ñ Don't you want me? ñ Don't you want my love? ñ Don't you want my lovin'? ñ Don't you want me? ñ Don't you want me? ñ Don't you want my love? ñ Don't you want me? ñ Don't you want me? ñ Don't you want my love? ñ Don't you want my lovin'? ñ Don't you want me? ñ Don't you want me? ñ Don't you want my love? ñ Don't you want me? ñ Don't you want me? ñ Don't you want my love? ñ Don't you want me? ñ Don't you want me? ñ Don't you want my love? ñ Don't you want my lovin'?
Imagination is funny ñ It makes the cloudy day sunny ñ Makes the bee think of honey ñ Just as I think of you ñ Imagination is crazy ñ Your whole perspective gets hazy ñ Starts you asking a daisy ñ What to do, what to do ñ Have you ever felt the gentle touch ñ And then a kiss, and then, and then ñ Find it's only your imagination again ñ Oh, well ñ Imagination is silly ñ You go around willy-nilly ñ For example, I go around wanting you ñ And yet I can't imagine that you want me too
Who is that girl? I think it's Cocaine-Kim ñ I've not seen her face in ages ñ Tell me where she's been ñ Oh, Cocaine-Kimberly is dancing by the door ñ Have you seen her slightly slender self ñ Sleeping on the floor? ñ  ñ Oh, Cocaine-Kim; that girls off the rails ñ Sparkling teeth, needle nights, champagne fairytales ñ Oh girl from Timperley ñ Who is that guy your with? ñ I hope he treats you really very nicely ñ The two days you've got left to live
Nero with his axes ñ And piles of skies gurgling ñ Behind him ñ Diocletian smiles ñ And the garlands of meat fall tall ñ Who made the windmills? ñ And who made the whirlpools? ñ Who made the crows? ñ And who made the stones? ñ Who formed the foam ñ From Aleph the Father? ñ Behind the flowers ñ The mother of the cows ñ Dreaming of trees ñ In the colouring fields ñ My face dissolves in folds ñ And I disappear
Eyes are bleeding ñ Scolding heat ñ Succumbing to the wish- ñ Not to feel anything at all ñ Rolling waves of nausea ñ Seeping through ñ My mind ñ Darkest abyss of conscience ñ Time will swallow ñ All ñ Converge upon me ñ Crushing all I see ñ Take away my pain ñ Purifying rain ñ I am swept away ñ Skies are gray now ñ No sun to guide me ñ The balance of opposites ñ Through self-annihilation
I wanna taste you ñ I wanna feel you ñ I wanna hold you tight ñ Just let me tease you ñ Just let me eye you ñ Pretend that you don't care ñ Intense moment ñ When our eyes crash ñ And from the wreck I emerge ñ With all the love ñ You ever dreamed of ñ Devoted to you yeah ñ Oh let me hold you for one last time ñ Your heartbeat stops ñ When I tell you ñ That lovers always part ñ A sad transmission ñ Brought to you by ñ Someone who doesn't care
My home is ñ A top security prison ñ I will ñ Never be released ñ Perseverance pays ñ From the files of murders ñ Only death can release me ñ And I will wait for it ñ Only death can release me ñ And I will wait for it ñ As patiently as I can ñ As patiently as I can ñ A life beyond the cage ñ A life beyond the cage ñ A life beyond the cage ñ A life beyond the cage ñ Missing ñ And feared dead ñ Missing ñ And feared dead
Does anyone know these lyrics?
Where do you go ñ To places unknown ñ I travel the road ñ Wherever you go ñ How does it go ñ See for your own ñ The faces unknown ñ The roots that I've grown
Every second you can see ñ Twenty-four pictures of reality
The blood that Jesus she'd for me ñ 'Way back on Calvary ñ The blood that gives me strength from day to day ñ It will never lose it's power ñ It reaches to the highest mountain ñ It flows to the lowest valley ñ The blood that gives me strength from day to day ñ It will never lose it's power ñ It reaches to the highest mountain ñ It flows to the lowest valley ñ The blood that gives me strength from day to day ñ It will never lose it's power
Your bowels infested - with embryonic mucus ñ Munch the saprogenic entrails - and desecrate the festered stiff ñ Ileum turns into lytic gore - devouring your skull ñ Collapsed internal parts - dislocated with a painful twitch ñ Pustulate, suppurate ñ Your innards now ñ A hot sticky mess ñ The oozing caress, of internal gases ñ Seeps out of your pores, a sickening, nauseating stench ñ Your cervix torn wide open - revealing a jelly mess ñ Your innards tumble out - in total disorder...
I don't oppose ñ I don't confront ñ Go with the flow ñ Hard to control ñ I do conform ñ I follow the norm ñ Swim with the mainstream ñ I'm not what I might seem ñ I can't be identified ñ Mr. Faceless personified ñ Without reflection ñ There's no detection ñ This is my strategy ñ I use the LCD ñ You can call me an infiltrator ñ I'm the Lowest Common Denominator ñ I won't protest ñ I won't disapprove ñ The faceless crowd ñ Covers my moves ñ I don't offend ñ Seem easy to bend ñ Don't have a profile ñ No godgiven style
Here I go chasing dreams again ñ Foolish child well I should have known ñ Seeds when sown grow up to be seen ñ Capture me come and set me free ñ Seems my mind wants to rund away ñ Everyday when I talk to you ñ (Repeat)
To Isengard though Isengard be ringed and barred with doors of stone ñ Though Isengard be strong and hard as cold as stone and bare as-bone... ñ We go we go we go to war to hew the stone and break the door ñ For bole and bough are burning now the furnace roars we go to war ñ To land of gloom with tramp of doom with roll of drum we come we come ñ We come we come with rool of drum with horn and drum we come
Tito: ñ Uno, dos, tres! (band starts playing salsa music) ñ Singer: ñ Wounds won't last long, but an insulting song ñ Burns will always carry with him ñ So I'll settle my score on the salsa floor ñ With this vengeful Latin rhythm ñ Chorus: ñ Burns! (trumpet riff) ñ Singer: ñ Con el corazon de perro ñ Chorus: ñ Senor Burns! (trumpet riff) ñ Singer: ñ El diablo con dinero. (mambo riff) ñ It may not surprise you, but all of us despise you ñ Please die, and fry in hell ñ You rotten rich old wretch ñ Adios viejo. (trumpet riff)

I step out in the road to feel the cool beneath my feet. I wonder if they will stop for me or if they'll ever come at all. The city stretches out beneath me, a reminder to a generation raised without stars. I hear the engines roll up and I know they are for me. So sucking my last free breath of re-invented air. Here's your freedom, "do what we say", a stolen gift from a politician. Deletion: directive of chrome
One evening when the sun was low ñ My brown eyes whispered, "I must go." ñ Not one minute would she wait ñ She kissed my cheek and left my gate ñ  ñ Those brown eyes I loved so well ñ Those brown eyes I long to see ñ How I long for those brown eyes ñ Strangers they have grown to be ñ  ñ One night I met her on the street ñ I tipped my hat but I could not speak ñ Another man was by her side ñ Soon I thought she'd be his bride

What can I do with my obsession? ñ With the things I cannot see ñ Is it madness in my being? ñ Is it wind that blows the trees? ñ Sometimes you're further than the moon ñ Sometimes you're closer than my skin ñ And you surround me like a winter fog ñ You've come and burned me with a kiss ñ And my heart burns for you ñ And my heart burns
You're inside my heart ñ And I can't get you out ñ It would shake itself apart ñ If I tried to stop you now ñ Down the boulevard ñ Everything's the same ñ Billionaires build cars ñ And children change their names ñ You make angels out of airplanes ñ Over the highway ñ When you spin around the room
You walk into your beautiful house ñ You stuff a steak in your beautiful mouth ñ You drive around in your big beautiful car ñ You blow your money on your beautiful hair ñ You think you're better cause you got more than me ñ You lose it all then who would you be ñ You're just a punk in a Mercedes Benz ñ You drive around to impress your friends ñ Taking me for a ride ñ Your bellies phat and you're ready for slaughter ñ You're bowing down to the all mighty dollar ñ Taking me for a ride...
I wake up in the basement ñ I'm so hungry ñ I'm dry ñ I must be here sleepwalking ñ Mustn't I? ñ Getting up from my easy chair looking for my wife ñ Following a trail of crimson ñ Spots that lead into the night ñ Suddenly I realize ñ I see it all through real eyes ñ These crimson spots are dripping from my hand ñ And ooh it makes me feel like a man
I'm goin' down, down, down, down, down, down ñ I'm goin' down, down, down, down, down, down ñ I got my big feet in the window, my head is on the ground ñ Let me down and closed that box car door ñ Let me down and closed that box car door ñ I'm going back to Chattanooga and sleep on sister Irene's porch ñ I'm goin' down, down, down, down, down, down ñ I'm goin' down, down, down, down, down, down ñ I got my big feet in the window, my head is on the ground
I don't know what love is ñ I don't know a thing ñ But something keeps me coming ñ Back to you again ñ I want it when it feels good ñ And need it when it hurts ñ I wanna know your secrets ñ And see you at your worst ñ So if your chest feel tight ñ My lungs will breathe for two ñ And if your heart's not right ñ Then mine will beat for you ñ Lean in ñ I'm gonna be there ñ I won't let you down ñ I don't think you know ñ How much I love you
Sweet 18, always trying ñ Sweet 16, always trying ñ To be something ñ  ñ Paint a picture on the wall ñ You like puppy dogs ñ You get bored of me ñ How I'm so naive ñ So naive ñ  ñ I won't be another girl ñ You kissed ñ Just a girl ñ You wish you hadn't missed ñ Hadn't missed ñ  ñ I'm almost 17 ñ Maybe then I'll know what you mean ñ I still don't want you ñ To speak to me
I Tried To Tell You, but you wouldn't listen ñ Tell you what's goin' on, show you where we went wrong ñ I Tried To Tell You, but you wouldn't hear me ñ That's why I wrote this song ñ (repeat)
Whereever I go, I take you with me ñ 'Cause I don't want to see you leave ñ Whenever I go, you stay with me ñ They won't see you leave ñ Are you here with me? ñ I want you here with me ñ Whenever I turn, you are gone from me ñ And I won't see you leave ñ Whereever I go, your shadow follows me ñ I don't want to see you leave ñ Are you here with me? ñ I want you here with me ñ You are here with me ñ And I am here with you ñ You are here with me ñ And I am here with you
Please kick my ass ñ Punch me in the face ñ I don't play sports ñ I'm a disgrace ñ Trip me in the hall ñ I'm not on the team ñ I'm dying to be a part of your scene ñ Gut you from the inside out ñ From your neck down to your sternum ñ That's what it's about ñ Entrails ripped from your fucking ass ñ Destroyed ñ Revenge is sweet ñ Now you're a mess on my floor ñ You scum sucking mother fucking road whore
Progress? That's just regression ñ Technology? That's nothing new ñ "Advance!" you scream insanely ñ "Advance"? From this to what? ñ And every time you smile, I smell decay, killer! ñ Your empty eyes stare, cold and grey, look at that face! ñ Machinery (master?), we're all expendable ñ It's just so obvious, it's more dependable ñ This progress will mean a number ñ Branded to your skin ñ They lead you to your slaughter ñ Like they lead a horse to water ñ They can't force you to drink ñ But you do!
Burn ñ Lest ye be bold ñ Until the quickening ñ Unlearned and sill untold ñ Praise not this dawn ñ (That will become tomorrow today) ñ The soil pressed into dust by the heel ñ Below nothing can ever return ñ Tower falls ñ Read ñ Reprise and reconvene ñ Take heed an emperor ñ Does not an empire make ñ Taste of this wine ñ (That has become tomorrow today) ñ Stolen limb from cast ñ Nothing will ever return ñ Ever ñ As we lie ñ Tower Falls ñ Search eye and you will find ñ Not idly they fly

She flies south in the summer ñ To take the sun and a lover ñ And I wonder why ñ I never tried to stop her ñ Or to ask her ñ  ñ What do you want from me ñ I don't know how you feel ñ I don't know what you need ñ What do you... ñ What do you... ñ  ñ I'm just a winter guest here ñ Though she makes me stay this calendar ñ Another spring slips by and I and I ñ Forget she's a leaving migrant ñ I don't know ñ  x6
Lost my heart to the winter ñ Takes some time of getting used to ñ There's a road I visit often ñ Where it forks off from view ñ Cross my fingers hope to die ñ Ask myself aloud reprise ñ Is there life after goodbye ñ What are we living for ñ What am I living for ñ Pick yourself up off the floor ñ Take a walk and then once more ñ Visit your good friend next door ñ Talk about your screaming thoughts ñ Feels like the dawn is at noon ñ Walking whenever I do ñ Help ñ Feels like death's song is moving in
Put one foot in front of the other ñ Is all I know ñ Before you know it you'll be falling down the road ñ And over at the crossroad they stole the sign ñ So all you do it walk through a straight line ñ Chorus: ñ Listen, Listen, My son, My son ñ I can't tell you twice what I can't tell you once ñ They bypassed the route I used to take ñ But you can't escape the time you now make ñ So I find myself on the highway on my own ñ The median's my pathway and my home ñ Chorus ñ Listen my son(c)2004 Declan Murray / Amith Narayan
This afternoon I burned my eyes out of my head, but from what I read I'm fine... Or dead ñ Now I understand just what was said.. I never did ñ Last night I died. Songs droned in fives ñ And in awkward times it creeps down my spine ñ Now I understand just what was meant when it was said that I was dead ñ And she sang these things only to me ñ The only one who understands what she means and dreams ñ We're completely streamed at the seams, she looks through me and begins to speak... ñ What did you say?
RINGMASTER ñ Imprisoned in the Tuilaries ñ The King makes locks ñ To the sound of the ticking clocks ñ And the rain falling on his window pane ñ Makes him think of his cousin Bourbon ñ Safe in his castle in Spain
I see how kite and bones I really am ñ And you'd excuse me if my throat fell out ñ Say I'm a window ñ And windows? ñ To pieces. To pieces. To pieces ñ And that, while I'm in headphones ñ In headphones on an airplane in an earthquake ñ Just stop stalking me around ñ Skull sighted ñ I can't see far away ñ But I can see the entire universe ñ And then I caught that on a teeter totter feeling ñ Like a fever or rash ñ (x2) ñ And all for my short film (x2) ñ Arsenic chic ñ Arsenic chic ñ Arsenic chic chic ñ (x2) ñ Arsenic chic
Time stands still ñ Call your name ñ Fall in love ñ But you say ñ Don't you dare fall in love ñ Don't you dare fall in love ñ Say I'm wrong ñ Just to late ñ All I know ñ Time won't wait ñ Don't you dare fall in love ñ Don't you dare fall in love ñ Time stands still ñ Call your name ñ Fall in love ñ But you say ñ Don't you dare fall in love ñ Don't you dare fall in love ñ Over and Over again ñ Over and Over again ñ Over and Over again ñ Over and Over again

You looked at me through old windows ñ And said, "Dust is all I know" ñ And you're so clean and I'm so tired ñ Like lovers' smiles and green marker miles ñ Chorus: ñ Can't go back that's much too far ñ I'm asking you to laugh ñ But after all ñ You love a tragedy ñ Hope remains a sidewalk star ñ Could you stay right where you are ñ You're so smooth, and I'm on fire ñ Holding on, just watching it unwind
Wise men say ñ Only fools rush in ñ But I can't help falling in love with you ñ Take my hand ñ Take my whole life too ñ For I can't help falling in love with you

I thought that writing a song about you ñ Would make me feel better ñ But no, this is the second one ñ And now i'm not that clever ñ I can't sleep with the thought of you in my head ñ When will this be over? ñ I swear I won't do a thing until you come to me ñ Just stay here or set me free ñ The feeling of us incomplete ñ Are you dead? Am I blind? We don't see ñ Touching you is just like a daydream ñ See you on a dark night? Maybe ñ This is the second one
I want to know how you feel ñ 'Cause I can't take it no more ñ Hurt me too many times ñ Like you did before ñ Now I'm changing my ways ñ Time I let you go ñ Shedding too many tears ñ I'm gonna let my anger show ñ I've got to pull myself together ñ Ain't got much time ñ Got to get myself together ñ And lay it, lay it on the line ñ I must have been blind ñ To miss what was going on ñ Took me for a fool ñ I thought I was wrong ñ Then you let yourself down ñ Showed your colours true ñ It was all a mistake ñ And now I'm leaving you
Ladies and gentlemen ñ It's time to rock da show ñ Let me introduce ñ The incredibly outstandin' artist ñ Let's rock! ñ It's time to rock da show, show ñ Everybody on the floor, floor ñ It's time to rock da show, show ñ Everybody on the floor, floor

I thought you wouldn't mind, we turned our amps up high ñ I thought you were sleeping anyway ñ When you see the signs, have turned into lines ñ You'll already have gone away ñ It's been on my mind, for a long, long, long time ñ How could you be sleeping all these days?

Cannot hold back. You broke her will. And she's never coming back

Baby, if word gets out that we're here ñ The press will be all over us
Maybe the truth in searching ñ Is not having found
The premature adaptation of the got it made game plan ñ The heartless work of the red in her dress ñ Alone has done some funny things to my friends ñ The pull of affection has a bleaching affect ñ A series of square-one references ñ Eleven eleven to one eleven tracers blaze ñ A glow off the face of a soldier ñ "things are going well young man." ñ Smile, pause, steady then...

Who danced with me ñ Before now ñ Who joined me ñ At the ship's bow ñ Who held my frightened form still ñ And now you say that you will ñ But in the years behind me ñ Who ever cared to find me ñ Who stayed me ñ When the tears ran ñ And now you say that you can ñ Forgive my sad suspicion ñ But hear my admonition ñ None yet have hoped for rescue ñ And now you say ñ That you do ñ Oh how I've wished past caring ñ That one might be so daring ñ And sail me to the next star ñ I almost think you are
The cactus where your heart should be ñ Has lovely little flowers ñ So though it's always pricking me ñ My ardor never sours ñ The cactus where your heart once was ñ Has power to rend and flay ñ I stick because I'm stuck, because ñ I just can't tear myself away
Glorious facade, slick tongue persistence ñ Syllable after syllable ñ Enchanting the artless ñ They're fish on hooks ñ Reel them in, cast them out ñ I see the flicker and burn ñ The breath inhaling the fumes ñ This temporary flame dances to a different tune ñ I see the flicker and burn ñ The breath inhaling the fumes ñ This temporary flame dances to a different tune ñ When you come to point your finger, you'll find three are pointing back ñ Can you taste the end?

No one from a glass has landed ñ The beam is down ñ Colours in regiments ñ Out of body experiences ñ The alien kidnappers ñ They place our graves ñ Ride the highways ñ Buying smiles ñ Bite off your tongue ñ Swallow it whole ñ Before it wags ñ Betrays us all ñ Purvey sour dreams ñ Will drink enterprise ñ Off-white off-set ñ Children of groceries

Mass ceremonial suicide ñ A nation of millions caught in the jaws of a lie ñ Uniform stagnant filth ñ Sub culture with no remorse or guilt ñ Feeding the frenzy of fears ñ It feeds on it's young for years ñ A new chain for the same set of slaves ñ A new shovel for the same set of graves ñ I can't pretend I care anymore ñ None of this is worth anything anymore ñ An angel with the eyes of a whore ñ This facade has been bleeding from the core ñ A new home not far from the past ñ A new home from the same suffocating past
Dirt roads, old cars, burnt oil, lovely hearts ñ All I breathe in, bleeds out, falls apart ñ Table cleared, dinner served - a modest start ñ Held back tears, never felt, pulled this hard ñ Dark skin, light hearts, unadorned, simple lives ñ I try to measure all my thoughts, all at once ñ And things seem clear ñ We've been lost from the start ñ Held back tears, never felt, pulled this hard

Am I out in limbo, less a man than a mannequin? ñ Am I out on a limb, burning daylight pining patiently? ñ A claim's made that intent is a backhanded compliament ñ But I'm taking each step like a fresh faced endeavor ñ "Hope springs eternal" ñ These are pointless words when they are engraved on a headstone ñ But whould I recognize a corpse if I was one? ñ (Does it take one to know one?) ñ We can't see our graves as we're in them

They came in from all sides ñ Their spartan eyes and battle cries ñ Piercing those who dared to try ñ Amongst the blood and broken spears ñ It's the smell of fear inside ñ That feeds their drive to stay alive ñ We'll surround them but one side
I cannot go on without you ñ But I know you'll stay on my mind ñ I cry ñ I still cry ñ Cry for you ñ My love ñ You won't return ñ But I miss you still ñ So I cry ñ I still cry ñ Cry for you ñ My love...
The sun is shining brightly ñ I'm afraid my mind is going I can feel it ñ Ausgeflippt ñ I honestly think ñ You ought to sit down calmly ñ Take a stress pill ñ And think things over ñ The sun is shining brightly ñ Ausgeflippt ñ I feel much better now ñ I really do ñ Ausgeflippt

Babylon ñ Instead he's getting close to God ñ Hot as heaven, but the whip game strong ñ Never been so lost ñ Babylon ñ Got him wondering where it all went wrong ñ Are they ever gonna play my song? ñ Will they remember me now, it's gone ñ  ñ Babylon (got him wondering where it all went wrong) ñ Babylon (will they remember me now, it's gone) ñ Babylon (got him wondering where it all went wrong) ñ Babylon (will they remember me now, it's gone) ñ  ñ It's not that strong, ooh ñ Not that strong, ooh
Let me take you to my place ñ It's ñ Just floating boat ñ We will have all the space ñ Come on boy ñ We will fish ñ Paradise ñ Life is very easy, if you leave a messi
I've been looking for a boy like you ñ All of my life ñ I've been looking for a love that's true ñ All of my life ñ I've been hoping for some happiness ñ All of my life ñ I've been waiting for a special kiss ñ All of my life ñ Been searching for a hand to hold ñ When things aren't right ñ To keep me warm ñ When I get cold at night ñ All of my life, all of my life ñ Been looking for a love like you ñ I can't wait 'till we say I do ñ Then I'll have all of you ñ All of my life, all of my life
I will pray to Lord ñ I run too far away from home ñ But I, when I will cross the sea alone ñ Cos' I can feel the energy ñ When the lord's been crying ñ Too many years ñ I will walk away for them ñ I see their thoughts in me again ñ But I, when I will dream this dream again ñ Cos' I can take this blame on me now ñ When the lord has been crying for me ñ Is my lord really crying ñ This long time for me? ñ For me again ñ But I, when I will dream this dream again ñ Cos' I can take this blame on me now
You'll die happy and you'll die smiling ñ You'll die happy and you'll die smiling ñ It hurts my soul to know you're crying ñ But you'll die happy and you'll die smiling
I know, although when looks meet ñ I tremble to the bone, ñ The more I leave the door unlatched ñ The sooner love is gone, ñ For love is but a skein unwound ñ Between the dark and dawn. ñ A lonely ghost the ghost is ñ That to God shall come; ñ I - love's skein upon the ground, ñ My body in the tomb - ñ Shall leap into the light lost ñ In my mother's womb. ñ But were I left to lie alone ñ In an empty bed, ñ The skein so bound us ghost to ghost ñ When he turned his head ñ passing on the road that night, ñ Mine must walk when dead.

The walls of the well as you're falling down into whatever lies below, blur from your sight out into the night. And the moon in the hole in the sky seems so far away, far away with your bag full of dreams wild-eyed and hailed on. Down on your knees again with a handful of sleep and a wondering eye you do what you can, but you find you're digging for icicles and only finding rain. You're digging for icicles and only finding rain
The pressure builds up deep inside ñ But there's no hope to run and hide ñ It's gonna make you sweat ñ You're gonna wind up wet ñ And it's no wonder why I'm so scared ñ I'm real scared- no turning back ñ No need for you and that's a fact ñ I'm real scared- no turning back ñ And I don't wanna die ñ We've got the heavies sitting on our chests ñ Weary tired but cannot rest ñ The razor's sharp ñ You're bleeding in the dark ñ And it's no wonder why I'm so scared
A see-saw, Ive had it walked again ñ A see-saw, Ive had it walked again ñ You dont like what you see ñ You must not care for me ñ  ñ Theres really nothin to it ñ And that is all I know ñ Theres really nothin to it ñ And that is all that I will show, to you ñ  ñ  ñ She creeps me out ñ She cranks me in again ñ She creeps me out ñ She creeps me out
What's gonna do ñ What's gonna do baby ñ An empty head is pretty ñ A strong body is healthy ñ A short life is dashed ñ Seize the day, hear the blood rush ñ La 
What ñ Do you keep on fighting for ñ The problematic storms ñ Get lost at sea ñ Why ñ Do you keep on trying for ñ The proclamations ñ They would leap ashore ñ Nothing ñ  ñ But it's alright ñ Because you know that you're alike ñ And the world ñ Is a reflection of your life ñ So you know ñ But you never really see ñ We cast it down ñ And then we turn the other cheek ñ  ñ No ñ No you can't keep fooling me ñ You won't catch no heart with a ñ Broke machine ñ Why ñ Are you for real ñ Tell me now ñ How does it make you feel ñ You feel
Stormy pinkness ñ Human weakness ñ Fills my johny cup with gloom* ñ Your progression ñ My digression ñ Forty days this afternoon ñ The things we cherish are small indeed ñ So much the larger the need ñ Stormy pinkess ñ Set me thanklessly free
("the way to keep people in line is to scare the shit out of 'em.") ñ Be dead ñ Be dead.... ñ ("there isn't anybody left.") ñ ("no no no!") ñ ("everything is running out.") ñ ("no no no!") ñ Be dead ñ Be dead.... ñ ("everything is running out.")
Deliver ghosts ñ To the crowd ñ The distant ñ And sequestered ñ Emerge again ñ Immorality ñ A small trace in ñ Half light ñ A dull relic ñ Locked-grooves ñ Emerge again ñ I materialize ñ A satire

Lyrics from Snippet
In case you thinking I'm trying to pull some of that old time nigga shit on you captain ñ I think you ought to know something ñ I hired the very best killers there are ñ White killers ñ White ones baby ñ So you better take good care of me ñ Nothing better happen to one hair on my gorgeous head ñ Can you dig it
I tried hard to be good to you ñ I felt peace inside my head ñ It's impossible to just be cool ñ Please please please ñ Don't don't don't ñ Walk like my single hope ñ We closed our lips and we called it our love ñ We swallowed a clover made of lead ñ It's unmanageable to just keep on living ñ Please please please ñ Don't don't don't ñ Walk like my single hope ñ I can only say it ñ So many times
Caged and oppressed ñ Their cries remain Supressed ñ Falling victim to human violence ñ Falling prey to human silence ñ Killing without necessity ñ This ignorance enraging me ñ Killing without necessity ñ Unrepentant ñ Killers of the innocent ñ Millions die with no real reason why ñ We consume to satisfy ñ We do not kill to stay alive ñ As a race we torture and we kill ñ In the name of a God given will ñ What reasoning is this? ñ Butchers, vivisectors ñ The killers should be killed
Something Wicked Comes ñ Lookin'Up For You ñ There's Nothing Wickeder ñ Than What's Already Real... ñ Walking Through A Mighty Dead Crowd... ñ Squiling Like A Pig ñ Fluoride is Kickin'In ñ Mind Is Like A Parachute ñ Works Better When It's Open... ñ Walking Through A Mighty Dead Crowd... ñ There's No Way Out...
I blame it on my entrance ñ It may have seemed too much like confidence ñ Let me start it over ñ Help me get to what I can from when I did ñ  ñ All that I know is how I can hold on ñ All that you see is how I let go ñ (Take me back, please) ñ  ñ Had to leave my reasons ñ It may have seemed too much, the consequence ñ And in your busy, dizzy life ñ You will become everything you said you would ñ  ñ All that I know is how I can hold on ñ All that you see is how I let go ñ So how about once around?
I drove between the lemon trees ñ Imagination of my daydreams ñ And I thought about the golden (?leafs?) ñ Manana was this (?dream?) ñ But suddenly a  broke in my mind ñ  be kind ñ Illusion instead of confidence ñ Some fellows want to suggest ñ One as ugly as their principles ñ As ugly as the rest ñ  ñ No worry, no game ñ With all intention ñ You have to force it ñ With all your action ñ You have to push it
The electric naked morning ñ Lives scared in the window ñ The dream-sick pain- light shattered ñ Penetrated and dead..........
I know he rescued my soul ñ His blood has covered my sin ñ I believe ñ I believe ñ My shame His taken away ñ My pain is healed in his name ñ I believe ñ I believe ñ I'll raise a banner ñ 'Cause my Lord has conquered the grave ñ My Redeemer Lives ñ My Redeemer Lives ñ My Redeemer Lives ñ My Redeemer Lives ñ You Lift my burdens ñ I'll rise with You ñ I'm dancing on this mountain top to see your kingdom come
The trees along the sidewalk ñ Are shadowing the light ñ For distant stars ñ And tenderly the night surrounds us ñ As we walk the quiet streets ñ While time is taken by the gentle wind ñ To make the space for love ñ The night surrounds us ñ As we walk the quiet streets ñ While time is taken by the gentle wind ñ To make the space for love ñ Your hand folds into mine
No one to talk with ñ All by myself ñ No one to walk with ñ But I'm happy on the shelf ñ Ain't misbehavin' ñ I'm savin' my love for you ñ I know for certain ñ The one I love ñ I'm through with flirtin' ñ It's just you I'm thinkin' of ñ Ain't misbehavin' ñ I'm savin' my love for you ñ Like Jack Horner ñ In the corner ñ Don't go nowhere ñ What do I care? ñ Your kisses are worth waitin' for ñ Believe me ñ I don't stay out late ñ Don't care to go ñ I'm home about eight ñ Just me and my radio ñ Ain't misbehavin' ñ I'm savin' my love for you

We fight and we strive to be the greatest ones, to be the heroes. We fight and we strive, and it's been our goal for the longest time, to reach the point of perfection. But we're fighting a war that's already been won. One sacrifice brings us back to life. One man who died to save our lives. He won't give up on us. He won't give up on us. This war within us is so impossible to win alone. And we confide in Him, and we confide in Him, we cannot win alone

Times a changing ñ Take control of your shiny toy ñ And break your hold ñ A failed reign of self control ñ A perfect imperfect laugh ñ Laughing down a hole ñ Searching for some clarity ñ Taste the powder on your tongue ñ Close the book on life today ñ Times a wasting -- take a look at yourself ñ Reflecting on your misery collapsing ñ Times a wasting -- take a look at yourself ñ Better late than never taste your powder burns
Tangled in my veins ñ We burned our eyes out staring at the early november sun ñ Oh, How I hate goodbyes
We are the sunshine ñ We are the light ñ We are the love in our hearts ñ We are the land ñ Oh, we are the sun ñ (We are the sunshine) ñ We are, we are the land ñ Oh, yeah, oh, we are the sun ñ Ooh-ooh... ñ Whoa, we are the loving in our hearts ñ Oh, we are the land ñ We are the sunshine ñ We are the light ñ We are the love in our hearts ñ We are the land ñ We are the sunshine ñ We are the light ñ We are the love in our hearts ñ We are the land...
Sleepless gliding ñ Over the city lights ñ Watch us flying ñ Over the streets tonight ñ And I say ñ There's a way, there's a way I know ñ There's a way, there's a way I know ñ There's a way, there's a way ñ I know that someday we will surely find it ñ There's a way, there's a way I know ñ There's a way, there's a way I know ñ Someday, there's a way ñ Someday, there's a way I know it ñ Sunday morning ñ Watching the city sleep ñ Dreams are shining ñ Finely they're within reach
Don't trust her, she'll break your heart ñ Would you change? Would you? ñ Hold tears you won't forget ñ Would you change? ñ All the way down ñ All the way down ñ All the way down ñ All the way down ñ Lie back, close your eyes ñ Would you change? Would you? ñ Think of anything ñ Would you change? ñ All the way down ñ All the way down ñ All the way down ñ All the way down ñ All the way down

Throw sad reflections to the wind where they belong ñ Surprising things will rise to the top ñ And hand=painted dreams flow ñ All of the pain has to go and find a space ñ For love will come and take its place ñ Full time illusions always hurt you in the end ñ And haunting ghosts can replay their part ñ To keep tender smiles down ñ Don't let them turn you around ñ The answer's clear your love has always been right here
Don't threaten me with Ahab's death, that's romantic ñ Because purity of heart is to will one thing ñ Don't tempt me with Monte Cristo's fate ñ Or Joseph's state around year 8 ñ I wanted love, I wanted acceptance ñ So pick me up Zarathustra ñ And drop me in the earth ñ Or else the sea, but first the fire ñ While I try to find some worth
(slapping on thighs) ñ  ñ My thighs hurt ñ I will stop slapping them now ñ I need to find another part of my body to, to slap ñ In order to continue the momentum of the song ñ How about ñ How about my, my, my booty? ñ How about I turn around and slap my booty? ñ (slapping) ñ Ooh, it's so much more percussive! ñ Highlights
Through the Darkening Tranquility ñ The Entwining of Twin Passion in Deepest Love ñ Of one Vision of the Immortal Graveyard ñ Centuries of Sleep on a Journey to my Rapture ñ As I gaze up through Spellbinding Branches the Deepest Snow ñ Falls thick Scorching into my Heart ñ The most Supreme Vision of all, for the Sharpening of Deepest Midnight ñ In the Essence of Perpetual Winter... is my Journey complete? ñ The Breeding of Witchcraft shall Consume the Night, to Unite as One - ñ A Living Immortal Monument...
I was walking down the street ñ And I saw her eye lying on the ground ñ And I thought to myself ñ "She didn't make it but I will ñ I'll stick around" ñ I wanna stay alive ñ I wanna die, not now ñ Ten years from now ñ I wanna live to be his bride ñ I wanna stay alive ñ I wanna stay alive ñ I wanna die ñ I wanna live to see his smile ñ When he meets me on the aisle ñ I wanna stay alive ñ I wanna stay alive ñ I wanna stay alive ñ I wanna stay alive ñ I wanna stay alive
Beauty mostly lie ñ In the goodbye ñ Because crimson flames ñ Are running through my veins ñ I just have to live ñ Without her ñ And I'll probably feel better ñ When you're gone ñ I'll never know ñ How close I came ñ Until I'll fall in love ñ (With you) ñ All over again ñ Beauty mostly lied ñ In the goodbye ñ Because crimson flames ñ Are running through my veins
My head is a helmet ñ Yellowbelly, c'mon ñ My legs are pillars ñ Yellowbelly, c'mon ñ My eyes are shields ñ Yellowbelly, c'mon ñ My head is a helmet ñ Yellowbelly, c'mon
And when she finally reached heaven ñ There was no light
Daddy DJ please take me to the party ñ And let me dance along until the lights are on ñ Daddy DJ please take me to the party ñ And let the music play until the break of day ñ Another night like a million before ñ Another party where I'm not invited ñ As always you'll heat the dance floor ñ In front of your turntables going mad ñ Why don't you keep me close to you ñ I'm not anymore the kid you knew ñ Why should I stay deep in the blue ñ I wanna move my body too

(Full) ñ As the twilight fades, so night casts its black mantle upon the world. The road into darkness is long, and its route perilous. Who amongst us has fortitude enough to take the first steps towards enlightenment? Who amongst us dares tread the darkling path to the Deep Halls, to be rebirthed and remade? You will yet discover what I have always known... you will yet witness that which I have seen. The claws of the blessed and the damned reach far
(30 seconds of silence)

When you say yes ñ Then I say no ñ When you stand still ñ Then I say no, and I say go ñ And I say go!

This time, I'll get so down ñ My own two feet won't stand on concrete ground ñ I'll see it caving in from all around ñ I may not look the same ñ I'll smile and chat and answer to my name ñ But if I'm bad, I don't deserve the rain ñ Oh, that's what you get ñ That's what you get, that's all ñ Oh, that's what you get ñ That's what you get, that's all ñ Oh, that's what you get ñ That's what you get, that's all ñ Oh, that's what you get ñ That's what you get, that's all

Lyrics from Snippet ñ  ñ -Oh my Lord ñ I'm in her throat like an Altoid ñ My girls got big lips, bitches on thyroid ñ My gun secret, I'm  ñ She take my dick, go like, "Ah-ah" ñ Sneak in that house just like Cory ñ I  like he crossed me ñ And the way  ñ  8 ball tour ñ Biddy baba, I ball full court ñ Chopper  a nigga, it's in full throttle ñ Call me  ñ I fuck her  ñ My bitch

Can you recall the days of innocence long left behind ñ They're like a dream that you can't retrace your steps to find ñ It's holding you by all the things you've hidden so far down inside ñ You just can't see a way to escape this life, you're so blind ñ It's killing me ñ To see you there ñ Wasting away ñ You can't give up what brings you down ñ I can't describe ñ How it felt to see the world through your eyes ñ But I can describe how this love makes me so alive
Everyone is floating by the graveside ñ Everyone is foreign when you're in another world ñ But the translation of sound is the same ñ  ñ You'll be made irrelevant by a suicide machine ñ Mechanically modified to muffle out the screams ñ Your novel grand possession, enrapturing soon ñ Tasting the festering, forbidden fruit
Have you ever been alone ñ So alone you thought you'd find ñ Memories on your doorstep of a love you left behind ñ In my mind, everything, something that I dreamed of ñ Now you're gone and I'm alone searching for what I might find ñ What I'm looking for ñ Memories left behind ñ Have you ever loved a woman so hard you though you'd die ñ Held her for so long; still she walked away ñ I say it's time to run away, hide in a new place ñ And when my conscience finds me, I will turn my face
You stand at attention ñ Like ladies and gents ñ When I mention my name at the door ñ And I hope that you pardon me ñ See by my card ñ I am finding a world we can explore ñ You're in the dream I have drawn ñ You're like the wings for my song ñ I get a lift with your gift ñ To know right from the wrong ñ Really strong ñ Our imagination will find this occasion ñ To go where you know we belong ñ Aah...ahh
Did you get it? I don't want your excuses. I want results!
I feel you ñ Don't say a word ñ I know how it feels to lose somebody ñ I see you ñ Walking upon your life alone ñ Like everybody ñ Nobody knows ñ What's about to happen ñ The feeling's getting strong ñ How I long the years of serenity ñ Nobody cares ñ What's about to happen ñ The feeling's getting strong ñ How I long the years of serenity ñ I feel you ñ Don't say a word ñ Now all I've ever dreamed ñ Is feel somebody ñ I see you ñ Walking upon your life alone ñ Like everybody
Long view into the dark ñ Moving your finger ñ You gonna make it for sure into the dark ñ Master of duel, rendezvoyeur ñ This is a walk into the dark ñ Playing the ball ñ Roll it on but not too fast ñ There she goes into the light ñ Close to your eye ñ Breaking the mirror ñ Gone out of sight ñ Flash in the rain ñ Sign of a walk into the dark..
Black smoke rising ñ From the stain of unearthly charred remains ñ Sweet young maiden ñ Blond and fair ñ Was a witch so we burned her there ñ As she burned she laughed out loud ñ From the sky fell a bloody shroud ñ As we gasped and gazed ñ With astonished eyes ñ Mystic Lady began to rise ñ Nothing grows here anymore ñ We painted crucifixes on our doors ñ Mystic Lady's spirit lives ñ We took her life so ours we give
Oh papa, don't be so mad ñ I'm taking the car for so very fast ñ You won't mind it missing at all ñ Oh papa ñ C'est ca va, don't worry 'bout me ñ I'll be safe, come home early ñ You won't mind me missing at all ñ Oh papa ñ Oh papa, don't be so mad ñ I'm taking the car for so very fast ñ You won't mind me missing at all ñ Oh papa
Just like that ñ You're gone ñ Never last for long ñ Please come back and give me something good tomorrow ñ Don't make me chase you to the bottom of a bottle ñ Tell me what's my worth ñ Separate from my work ñ What have you done? You leave me here with all this pressure ñ To beat the last song that I wrote ñ But will I ever ñ Should I have kept you in my head ñ Haven't been happy since you left ñ It's back to the drawing board ñ Again

A governmental promise is just a disguise ñ And a bad excuse for their real intimidations ñ It's just a fucking masquerade! ñ A restrained government is just another slave ñ In the red-tape society that leave us all behind ñ It's just a fucking masquerade! ñ A governmental cut-down or rationalization ñ Is the highest form of terrorism ñ It's just a fucking masquerade! ñ A "worker's politician" is just a cover-up ñ For the reasons behind the mistakes ñ It's just a fucking masquerade!

Say hello to the children born today ñ You and I know they'll soon be on their way ñ To live a life and see what they may see ñ What kind of people do you think that they will be? ñ Say so long to the ones who've passed away ñ You and I know that nature has her ways ñ Were they happy and were their hearts content? ñ I hope they felt like their time here was well spent ñ Is this the beginning ñ Or is this the End? ñ Are you happy? ñ Is your heart content?

Many roads we have traveled ñ Many skies we have seen: ñ Only to the stars we have yet to be ñ There, where our hearts will forever beat! ñ Homecoming sweet will be: ñ Having braved the endless seas ñ To see the green of Uppsala's hills ñ Homeward bound I be! ñ Brothers let us sail to the North ñ Back to the land of our Fathers ñ Where the Gods of thunder and war ñ Await our ship to reach the shore! ñ Homecoming sweet will be: ñ Having braved the endless seas ñ To see the green of Uppsala's hills ñ Homeward bound I be!
The ward was arraigned with spats of blood ñ The victim, castigate, and yet, part of us ñ The thoughts in eyes as seen under a hood ñ Burned in my own eyes and in my blood! ñ Mark'll sink us ñ A message mesmerized, on all English breath ñ The crux pretty grasped, but mostly misunderstood ñ Mark'll sink us ñ I am desolate. I live the black and blue of the night ñ Friend depression comes now and again once in a blue moon ñ It points backwards thus: ñ Mark'll sink us

Oh, what a piece of work is man ñ How marvelously wrought ñ The quick contrivance of his hand ñ The wonder of his thought ñ Why need we look for miracles ñ Outside of nature's laws ñ When man is what to wonder at ñ With every breath he draws ñ But give him room to move and grow ñ But give his spirit play ñ And he can make a world of light ñ Out of the common clay
I just want to give birth to some meaningful prose ñ In a fucked-up world that points the way to be free ñ And change the way you see your whole gaga life ñ Now people,start walking towards the radical sound ñ Get no idea who the real enemy is now ñ This sound attacks you most violently ñ To revolutionize this industry ñ Now people, start walking towards the radical sound ñ Get Loud!You get strong from it ñ And be set free now ñ Go with it now cuz' it starts from here
In light and dark ñ swallow ñ or be swallowed... ñ as one and another... ñ one and another ñ one for the other ñ one... ñ for the other ñ in the deep or in the shallow ñ we all end up ñ deep or shallow ñ drowning in the sea ñ of the universal power ñ in the greatest hour ñ forced to our knees ñ by the highest power ñ by the highest power

Collapsed in sunbeams, stretched out open to beauty however brief or violent ñ I see myself ablaze with joy, sleepy eyed, feeding your cat or slicing artichoke hearts, ñ I see myself sitting beside you, elbows touching, hurt and terribly quiet ñ The turquoise in my ring matches the deep blue cramp of everything ñ We're all learning to trust our bodies, making peace with our own distortions ñ You shouldn't be afraid to cry in front of me. I promise.
This is the end of confrontism ñ This is the end of capitalism ñ Maybe some day it'll happen, I'll await that day ñ But right now it seems it's how much you pay that counts ñ Natural harmony ñ World resources equally distributed ñ Maybe some day it'll happen, I'll await that day ñ But right now it seems it's how much you pay that counts ñ Maybe some day it'll happen, I'll await that day ñ But right now it seems it's productivity that counts

Far over the Misty Mountains cold ñ To dungeons deep and caverns old ñ We must away, ere break of day ñ To find our long-forgotten gold ñ The pines were roaring on the heights ñ The wind was moaning in the night ñ The fire was red, it flaming spread ñ The trees like torches blazed with light

Walking the brim of chaos with destruction on my mind face the faceless and stand fearless ñ This world can be a wretched place filled with hatred ñ When all hope is lost look to the darkest corner to find a solution sometimes it can take death to find life ñ With a re born vengeance take the world in the palm of your hand and brake empty every face that stairs at you're with pride ñ Brakes every empty face destroy every fictional mind ñ Stop every blackened hearty can take your life and make it count
There she stands ñ In the middle of a flowing world ñ Like a leaf in the wind ñ And she looks around ñ To the center of a rushing crowd ñ All the people go mad ñ They just turn their heads ñ To the deadlines & production needs ñ Leaving her lost and alone ñ So she walks the streets ñ Unfamiliar with industrial sounds ñ And the hovering machines ñ It distorts her mind ñ Her perception of reality ñ Like a scene out of a dream ñ On an empty stage ñ In a constant morphing scenery ñ She discovers herself flowing free

Got a message on the phone ñ She said let's meet I'm all alone ñ Do you want to see me die ñ Would you please stop by ñ She knows I follow her around ñ Ever since she came to town ñ She dreams about me in her sleep ñ I feel it's something she can keep ñ Let me down ñ Walk around ñ See me cry ñ So let me die ñ Solo ñ My friends stop to ask me why ñ They don't want to see me die ñ If you follow her home ñ She lives on the wrong side of the road ñ Let me down ñ Walk around ñ See me cry ñ So let me die
There's nothing, there's nothing without you ñ I give this rose to you ñ Now why am I here when they will remain? ñ Am I nothing but a shadow hiding, fading into the dark? ñ I declare my love for you ñ I have nothing but you ñ Am I nothing but a shadow? ñ God if you took me would they even care? ñ Am I nothing but a shadow? ñ Am I nothing but a lost soul? ñ Oh creator of this world ñ Show compassion, I give control ñ Raise me up and now I'm gone
(Snippet) ñ Baby I was born to shake it ñ Baby I was born to run ñ Come now, I wanna get naked ñ Let me out, into the sun ñ I'm on the hunt for loving ñ I'm on the prowl for life ñ I want something
Letra de "Saliste A Buscarme" ft. Jowell & Randy ñ !La letra completa estara disponible pronto!
Satan is the name he goes by ñ He got a lotta devil in his eye ñ He got a kiss of fire and it burns you well ñ Breaks your heart and it hurts like... ñ It hurts like hell ñ Old hands or beginners ñ With him there are no winners ñ When you fall you seal your fate ñ A look of love soon turns to... ñ A gaze of hate ñ "The devil himself", they call him ñ And you'll know it soon as you fall in ñ He got a kiss of fire and it burns you up ñ Breaks your heart and it hurts like... ñ It hurts like fuck
Leaving your side ñ Isn't harder than leaving the room ñ I'm surrounded while you're alive ñ I can no longer sell out & lose you ñ Forever holding me ñ How long is always ñ Answer forever ñ How long is always ñ Answer forever, underground ñ Sidelined ñ Underground ñ Love is like a thousand burning needles ñ Pushing through my skin ñ They work their way inside ñ Coldness from within ñ A lonely sun will reach the skies above ñ Ascending over me ñ The years all seem like days ñ As seconds look the other way ñ How long is always...
I wanna see you ñ Especially you ñ You don't know how much I miss you ñ Ha, ha.  I may be high, I may hide and run out at you ñ You don't know how much I miss you ñ  ñ I won't stop ñ I'll run ya down ñ I won't stop ñ I will run ya down ñ I'm all nerve ñ I'm all nerve ñ  ñ I hit the hull (oh god) ñ Oh god, I hit them all ñ You don't know how far I would go ñ I may hide and jump out at you ñ You don't know how far I'd go ñ  ñ I won't stop ñ I won't stop ñ I will run you down ñ I'm all nerve ñ I'm all nerve
I know, I know, I know, I know that it happens like this ñ I know, I know, I know, I know that I shouldn't think about it any more ñ But I want to hear someone say that this too ñ Shall pass ñ And I have seen it all before, I know how it will end ñ It will end as it does when there is fear of the unknown ñ But I want to hear someone say that this too ñ Shall pass ñ I know, I know, I know, I know that one day ñ If we still remember, it will only be vaguely ñ But I want to hear someone say that this too ñ Shall pass

Only oceans are between us ñ And it is through you that I believe I could live again ñ And if I should pass I will rest in your ocean ñ For these are the waters that once drowned me ñ Where is the light in my lonely existence? ñ I brave the dark and the waters bleak ñ For I've seen your image in the minds eye ñ Fear is alluring but pain is no temptress ñ  ñ There's no point in coming crawling ñ The mighty temptress has fallen ñ There's no point, no point, no point in coming crawling

Look for the way to find out air ñ We've spent too many tears to wash the earth ñ Look for the way ñ We've spent too many tears no life no air ñ Look for the way to find out air ñ We've spent too many tears harvest the earth ñ Look for the way ñ We've spent too many tears no life no air
Farewell you beloved earth and skies ñ Blessed forever you will be ñ For when she began gently her dance ñ The fair below the crystal moon ñ It all into nothingless fell ñ If hardly a bit the eye will recall ñ If once again chaos enters ñ ...her face so pale and noble ñ With it's twilight, dawn, earth and skies ñ Our world still had a meaning... ñ ...It to the dancer once gave life
There's an hour that comes like a healing balm ñ When the evening shades are falling ñ When we lay our care at the Savior's feet ñ His gift of grace recalling ñ Lovingly now fervently bow ñ This is the hour of prayer

Certainly the children have seen them ñ In quiet places where the moss grows green ñ Coloured shells jangle together ñ The wind is cold, the year is old, the trees whisper together ñ And bend in the wind, they lean ñ Next week a monkey is coming to stay ñ If I was a witches' hat ñ Sitting on her head like a paraffin stove ñ I'd fly away and be a bat ñ Across the air I would rove ñ Stepping like a tightrope walker ñ Putting one foot after another ñ Wearing black cherries for rings

I'll be there ñ Waiting to sail ñ I don't know ñ Where I'll go ñ Go to the sailboats ñ To the end of the world
In the dying embers of a burnt-out day ñ When morning seems a thousand hours away ñ Dark prevails and the light gives up the fight to stay ñ The blackness thickens and surrounds ñ Masking all but distant sounds ñ I seek for thought to occupy still conscious mind ñ As calm and peace surround my bed ñ I feel that sleep is not far ahead ñ But in place of slumber comes a bolt of fear instead
I dreamt of cash in my head ñ I dreamt of princesses in foreign lands ñ I dreamt of love and affection ñ My lord's blessings ñ I asked for answers to the questions ñ They got so many guessing ñ And they all point the same direction ñ The same point that I'm missing ñ My dancer from Brazil ñ A love I can't conceal ñ I've been after love for years ñ And I think I'm getting near ñ To my dancer from Brazil ñ From Brazil

Cooked brains ñ Melted flesh ñ Sizzling eyes ñ Burning death ñ Boiling blood ñ Stench of death ñ Charred bones ñ Ashes left
A sacrifice in the flight of dawn ñ The beauty of twisted reality ñ In my heart, my dreams ñ A sacrifice for freedom ñ Alone in the grace of the dark ñ The pains of a failed generation ñ I longed for the death of the sun ñ Another glorious revelation ñ Destiny's plan for ruin ñ I danced with the shadows ñ In tranquil chaos, I lay naked in the rain ñ An interception of light ñ A disturbing memory ñ This suicide veil I wear in shame
An exact terminus ñ Deposits Cesium 1-3-7 ñ Into acres of dead ash ñ Endowed with cancer ñ As the ground ñ Crumbles beneath our feet ñ Acidly ñ Farming out the Earth's marrow ñ A litmus tested metaphor ñ Proven for conscienceless rape ñ Serial catastrophe ñ Cumulatively irreparable damage ñ Destruction has set ñ A limitless bound ñ China syndrome ñ Green peace ñ Area ñ Trinity
Searching for another sign ñ Something to make me believe that this time ñ It's real ñ And that I'm not the only one who is bound ñ Overload of memories ñ I can't break this wall that holds me back ñ I'm nothing in the world of lies ñ With no right to fantasize ñ I took the life from your world ñ Potent, unforgiving ñ I took the knife from your hand ñ And placed it in your blackened heart ñ I know now that I am falling ñ Into another dream ñ I can hear the angels calling ñ I hear the children scream
We gave you our love ñ We gave you our love ñ As we bent to do wrong ñ Your smile was the wind ñ Your smile was the wind ñ As it swept us along ñ Why can't you understand ñ That we can't build to lines of a plan ñ What's the use, what's the use...
I took a hammer, and a chisel iron cold ñ And had my dreams engraved on a mountaintop of stone ñ But the mountain crumbled my dreams in seas of blue; ñ There's nothing in this world as forever as you ñ I touched the earth with a question in my hand ñ I asked two holy men to help me understand ñ But the preachers quarreled as to just what I should do; ñ There's nothing in this world as forever as you ñ In these temporary days ñ You're my sole and saving grace ñ There is nothing in this world as forever as you
Bring the floods ñ Cleanse with fire ñ Let us pray ñ Pray for death ñ Nothing more to remember ñ See the error all around ñ Endless thirst in a sea of blood ñ The banners ripple in the wind ñ Writhing 'neath our skins ñ A gift of the gods below ñ Scrubbed raw yet never clean ñ Now we summon the fiend ñ Pray for death ñ Let us pray
There is no greater love ñ Than what I feel for you ñ No sweeter song, no heart so true ñ There is no greater thrill ñ Than what you bring to me ñ No sweeter song ñ Than what you sing, sing to me, ooh ñ You're the sweetest thing ñ That I've ever known ñ And to think that you are mine, you are mine alone ñ There is no greater love ñ In all the world, it's true ñ No greater love ñ Than what I feel for you
We rattle chains, and we question how we are trained ñ We speak words profane ñ We'll be banging pots and pans until you understand: ñ We're following a different plan ñ Tried to live the good life, I just wasn't good enough ñ Tried to live the simple life, I wasn't simple enough ñ Tried to live the high life, I couldn't get high enough ñ We won't let you forget
I can't give you anything but love, baby ñ That's the only thing I've plenty of, baby ñ Dream a while, scheme a while ñ We're sure to find happiness and I guess ñ All those things you've always pined for ñ Gee, I'd like to see you looking swell, baby ñ Diamond bracelets Woolworth doesn't sell, baby ñ Till that lucky day you know darned well, baby ñ I can't give you anything but love

Something's got to give us feelings ñ Feelings we have lost since we died ñ What is underground we can try to understand ñ I could never mean to bury you ñ I can't move they think i'm dead ñ I shall travel when i am asleep ñ Underground far and deep ñ There's a place that i can see you i fall into it sometimes
Sideways ñ Sometimes ñ Some things ñ Feel like ñ I'm on the other side ñ Waves ñ Of every feeling ever felt ñ Screaming ñ This is how it all begins ñ This is how it all begins ñ I can almost see (...how it all begins) ñ The blackest eyes ñ The new flesh ñ This is how it all begins ñ Give it to me ñ I can take it ñ Give it to me ñ I can take it ñ Give it to me ñ I can take it ñ Give it to me ñ I can take it ñ Give it to me ñ I can take it ñ Give it to me ñ I can take it ñ I've begun ñ I've begun ñ I've begun ñ I've begun
Hello, it's me, it's Tyiese ñ Um, so, did you want me to say RARE Sound?
This darkness, so slumb (and) this atmosphere, my hands were numbed ñ The only movement was the flames of black candles ñ Who cleansed the air in this chamber of death ñ My head was slunt as I gazed into the flaming candles ñ Visions filled my mind ñ Visions of a rising desecrated power ñ In this chamber of death, black roses grew ñ Up from the ashes of souls who lost for my lust and desire ñ There they will stand as a monument for victory ñ Over our christian annhilation
When the moon rise I'down ñ Soon as 'down the street ñ And I travel down ñ When the dark  ñ And it so simple how ñ For the  ñ The sky braking down ñ Get the feeling ñ Ooh this shadows ñ And this nothing I can accept  down ñ I'm just sitting for the way ñ You've been sitting down
How many nights do you lie dreaming ñ I'm counting the days since you went away ñ When I lost my heart, life lost all meaning ñ What I would give to see you again ñ  ñ I'll pray for you ñ Do you pray for me? ñ I'll pray for you ñ  ñ And you slipped away from me without talking ñ The look in your eye was stronger than this ñ And I drink alone to stop me from weeping ñ What's left of my heart is forever yours ñ Forever yours ñ  ñ I'll pray for you ñ Do you pray for me? ñ I'll pray for you ñ  ñ I know I know I know I know
I'm blind for what you're showing me ñ I'm so restless ñ You just needed to keep it all for yourself ñ I don't know ñ  ñ Sinking, you better try ñ I'm so restless ñ You tested us ñ You kept it all for yourself ñ I don't know ñ  ñ Without hunger ñ There's no longing, ah ñ Without blinding ñ There's no light, ah ñ  ñ I'm blind for what you're showing me ñ I'm so restless
I resist ñ But there's no point in it ñ Why lovers feel shame ñ What for? ñ We'll never know ñ Cuz we are strange ñ Too lost to rearrange ñ In an empire's final glow ñ Oh will we never knowss ñ Kissing girls ñ You shouldn't ñ Cuz if it falls again ñ One more kiss ñ Could never be enough ñ The city sleeps ñ But what time do lovers keep ñ In a world that's burning down ñ What time is it now? ñ We're beautiful ñ Naked and vulnerable ñ Empty as a hotel room ñ Without any view
I've been farther out ñ I found out that something's wrong ñ There's no phone around here ñ Won't be gone awhile ñ Wait and see before you dial ñ Cause I know what you mean ñ Maybe once in a while ñ I can see without pretending ñ I don't know, now that it rings ñ I know where I've been ñ Half a world is seen for a mile ñ It's behaving now ñ Crossed the line and two lanes down ñ It's the point that is dear ñ Got it in the car ñ Missed a left and drove too far ñ Didn't know anyway
Sprawled in the dust outside Syrian store ñ A target for small children, dogs and flies ñ A heap of verminous rags and matted hair ñ Sometimes he shows his stumps of yellow teeth ñ The curse of pitty, a grotesque mask of death ñ With hands like claws about his begging bowl ñ Lost in the trackless jungle of his pain ñ Clutching the pitless red earth in vain ñ And whimpering like a stricken animal ñ How the other half live-so much yet so little
Archie, the day is so long ñ But you are way too small ñ To keep on carrying on as you do ñ So it's time to go to sleep ñ Don't make a peep ñ Little Archie, goodnight to you
Lord of all the earth ñ How You care for me ñ You have made me ñ You will save and carry me always ñ You are faithful ñ You are faithful ñ You are faithful ñ Your joy is my strength ñ Lord you are my God ñ I rely on You ñ I put my hope in things not seen ñ Your promises all true ñ Always you're with me ñ Your hand will lift me ñ My trust is in your hands ñ Always you're with me ñ Your hand will lift me ñ My trust is in your hands
Been through ñ I need a plan to put my lips on you ñ And I do
We are The Prodigy ñ Invaders must die ñ Invaders must die ñ Invaders must die ñ Invaders must die ñ Invaders must die ñ Invaders must die ñ Invaders must die ñ Invaders must die ñ Invaders must die ñ We are The Prodigy ñ Invaders must die
Change my pitch up ñ Smack my b**** up ñ Change my pitch up ñ Smack my b**** up ñ Change my pitch up ñ Smack my b**** up ñ Change my pitch up ñ Smack my b**** up ñ Smack my b**** up ñ Smack my b**** up ñ Change my pitch up ñ Smack my b**** up ñ Change my pitch up ñ Smack my b**** up
One, two, three ñ Who knows how long I've loved you ñ You know I love you still ñ Will I wait a lonely lifetime? ñ If you want me to, I won't ñ Yes, you will
Pray the one my soul to keep ñ Servant's service ñ Too scared to sleep because of the creep ñ Scarred surface ñ Well in the right now ñ When I'm next to your head I see white ñ Heaven's presence ñ Mother dying all of the time ñ My sickness ñ Well in the right now ñ We'll take you ñ We'll take all of you ñ Well in the right now

The final snow has fallen ñ The north wind fell silent ñ Rushing waters awaken ñ Yet the worlds are still ñ Wandering ghost ñ In the valleys ñ On the verge speckled hills ñ And the north awakens from winter's chill ñ How many more glorious winters will we survive? ñ There may only be a few ñ Perhaps we'll never know ñ But the answer will haunt us ñ So ask the moss beneath the snow ñ Perhaps we'll never know ñ But the answer will haunt us ñ So ask the moss beneath the snow
I have lost your heart, between light and shade ñ I have lost your heart, seeds of duality ... ñ I have lost your heart, in frontiers of manias ñ I have lost your heart, here died my childhood ñ Black flowers grow in my hands, creatures from my inner world ñ Emergency of liquid language, stalker in quest of emotions ... ñ Multiple sides of illusion, serenity had crossed my mind ñ Indelible visions come from cells, battle worn away in time spiral
Embrace the world outside ñ Go on and chase the fears you hide ñ A tree is not afraid ñ To see a horizon ñ Once again, once again the light has come ñ The light has come ñ In a hush
The clouds attacked slowly obscuring everything we ñ Took out our eyes and pretended we could see
Dark clad waters, still warm shrouds ñ Doomsday warning from the men in the clouds ñ Lily's weep over light that fled ñ Words were carved in my arm by the dead ñ Grim like war, foul like tar ñ Corroded fragments of a dying star ñ Sleepy herons abruptly awake ñ As the black god arises from the cold of the lake ñ Figure of smoke, emerald head ñ Magnificent is the king of the dead ñ Somewhere beyond the sun still shines ñ But even snow dies sometimes
Us ñ Babe ñ Family ñ Friends ñ Revenge ñ Lust ñ Love ñ Don't forget the money ñ If you got something to live for ñ You probably got something to kill for ñ You might just have something to die for ñ If you got something to live for ñ Live for ñ If you got something to ñ If you got something to ñ If you got something to ñ If you got something to live for ñ Live for

Knock Knockin, who's there? ñ Matado at the door; knocking till midnight ñ Sell his soul to hell, he lost the bull fight ñ Nothing's okay; everything's no-kay? ñ Between the matador and his wife ñ He's still knocking until the early morning
Through the fields of flame i ran with you ñ Every blow you took i took with you ñ I lied for you when you moved underground ñ And covered you as the storm of rage came down ñ But i will not wear you like a purple heart ñ To the raging moon burning in the sun ñ I held on to you you held on to no one ñ I followed you 'til you were out of sight ñ And felt the pain as the bullets took the night ñ But i will not wear you like a purple heart
Lyrics from snippet ñ  ñ Kiss me on the neck, suck the pain away ñ I was happy, but that was yesterday ñ Death is just days away ñ But, thats okay ñ  ñ Now I'm thinking bout a different escape ñ Tell me good luck and I'm going that way ñ My life is a book and you got your own page ñ They keep calling, but I let it ring

Of all of our friend's unfortunate stories. this may be the worst, you're still sittin' still ñ (i'm busy busy busy) ñ It's not all so bumper sticker slogan simple ñ To see and to be seen. to see and to be seen ñ Maybe you never really ever even realized, all this maybe... ñ To see and to be seen

The human blood is far too thin ñ The life in it much too fragile ñ DNA code twisted into form ñ An ancient dream will now be reborn ñ Demonic!

I was a little bit surprised when you told me that everybody on your tour had faith. I, yeah, I find it so rare meeting people that are young and do believe here. I think it's why I find it so much easier to even speak about these things when I'm in different places. Like, even, even in Europe, like, real Europe, not England Europe. Um, like, the notion of it is more around

It's so cruel to let people love you ñ All you're doing is promising you'll one day break their hearts ñ Cool fire pit! ñ  ñ Wake up feelin' anxious ñ *STILL IN WORK*
I'd rather die young than grow old without you ñ So don't ever leave me whatever you do ñ To see someone's picture where my picture hung ñ Believe me my darling I'd rather die young ñ I'd rather die young than grow old without you ñ So don't ever leave me whatever you do ñ Though others may tempt you and tell you they care ñ You'll find only sorrow in a secret affair ñ Don't leave me never leave me please don't leave me never leave me ñ I'd rather die young ñ  ñ I'd rather die young
When the Torch is coming down there, it was just, it was coming from thousands of miles away. It was something special.

Skipping heads on cold fists on rivers lines in black ñ I should think ñ I should quiver ñ Skinned heads with cold blades ñ I'm down with sin ñ I should shake ñ Tanned hide and sun-dried skin plagues ñ A man gagged in twine
I live my life just to see you ñ Remember what you said - I believed you ñ I'd never danced so fast - I got tired ñ But now we step so slow in the quiet ñ We got love so I won't let it be ñ I threw my stones to the river ñ Swam to your front door to be delivered ñ Your father showed me in to the fire ñ Your mother said to me she seems tired ñ I live my life just to see you ñ Help me understand what you've been through ñ Cause I can't reach my dreams if they're silent
Here you are after all your traveling ñ And have you found your way ñ Did you loose your time here ñ Too many forms in the way ñ All your life you've been ill treated ñ Hurt most all your life ñ No help and mislead ñ You wish to say goodnight ñ You say there is no tomorrow ñ I urge you to be brave ñ I beg you, love each other ñ Turn night into day ñ Although Increasing Deserts ñ Decrease all your land ñ You are only losing ñ Unless you take my hand

Monumental freaks ñ Daddy was just danger ñ Mommy slept with strangers for free ñ Monumental freaks ñ My sister was a screenplay ñ She built the stage then just rolled away ñ How long can a dog chase a fly? ñ How long can a girl wave goodbye? ñ How long can the drugs keep you high?
I know you hate me for the things I do ñ That's okay because I hate you too ñ I'll tell my friends that you'll never be one of them ñ I'd rather die alone than talk to you ñ You called out my name ñ Getting a little sick of all your stupid games ñ So we sit here again in silence and pretend ñ That there's something going on ñ With me and my friend ñ And I wish I knew what you were thinking too ñ I've had enough of this shit and I'm leaving you ñ You said you knew and I'm pretty sure you did too ñ That you did too
Romance interrupt my atomic dream ñ Imagine you awake with me ñ It's just lightning, you'll see it rain ñ Before thunder can I have you again ñ I pictured something clean and dry ñ I saw no need to purify ñ In this sweaty night some dry heat ñ May be a good thing howling in the street ñ It won't be no lovers who condemn ñ The perfect heat that fuses them ñ I pictured something clean and dry ñ I thought that it would purify
Right then, now it's gone ñ Can't you see Vera sitting at your window? ñ Any clear, you were wrong ñ Cause nothing's here, all the bricks have turned to crystals ñ  ñ I've seen this before ñ Flames burn as night falls ñ You are the only thing left to fall ñ So let it burn ñ  ñ Let it burn, let it fall ñ Let it burn, let it fall ñ Let it burn, let it fall ñ Let it burn ñ  ñ All we have are memories ñ That turn to ash and are floating in the distance ñ You must've known that we would crash ñ With all this hay burning in our systems
To Eden with me you will not leave ñ To live in my cottage of crazy crooked Eves ñ In your own heavy home ñ Take care of this night ñ When you let your little cat in ñ Turn on the light ñ Something scurries behind ñ And finds a cozy place to stare ñ Something sent to you from paradise ñ Paradisically somewhere ñ Tongues flouring ñ They leap out laughing ñ Lapping ñ Disappear

I wish I could count on you ñ I wish I could count on you, oh baby ñ I can't stand it ñ Fussing and fighting all day long ñ Tossing and turning everything seems wrong ñ I can't stand it ñ I wish I could depend on you ñ I wish I could depend on you oh, baby ñ I can't stand it ñ I'm a man with a loving soul ñ Got the things just to rock your soul, oh baby ñ I can't stand it ñ You go west, I go south ñ All I know I'm checking out ñ I can't stand it

Go to the shore and ñ Pray for the sea ñ Go towards the mirror and ñ Pray that you'll see ñ Someone else ñ Downtown ñ Go downtown ñ  ñ Go to the waves of grain ñ In the center of the state ñ Go away ñ Go to a parking lot ñ Sit on the ground and cry ñ You'll never know why ñ Start over ñ  ñ Go to the ocean ñ On a ship ñ Wave goodbye to the waves ñ And the ñ Frozen shit ñ That was in your heart ñ  ñ So long ñ Time slows when it goes away ñ Go away ñ Time slows ñ So long
Subtract the greed that spurs you on and there's no room for them in your shitty scene. Feeding on a carcass to sustain a following. Nobody wins. You want it all and you spoil it for nothing. The Scene is dying. You bleed it dry. You'll get what you want. You feed on us, but you're so wrong. Now running out of fuel who worships you. You persecute you. The music fails you. Who hails you? The royalty of a shitty scene. It's a joke you can keep it
Here's a note to say I'm fine ñ But words escape between the lines ñ And tell the story, gone is glory ñ Of all our love, fade to dust ñ But it's over and done now ñ Like a bottle placed on the sea ñ The story of how ñ You were once a part of me ñ What's become of our love? ñ Just what's that word I'm speaking of? ñ When no more the trust, love deserted us ñ We have built our world on sand ñ Now is the hurting ñ Now is the pain ñ But there will be an answer ñ On the way ñ I'll keep holding on
Im Takin' my time ñ Passin' right by ñ Hell, I thought I'd let this thing unwind ñ Last time I seen light (or life) ñ Shut down round and round ñ Hidden far beyond ñ A giant red star ñ Orion shinin' on one side ñ Last time I seen light ñ Shut down round and round ñ (repeat)

"Just in Love" is a song that I wrote about a relationship that I was going through and the frustration that sometimes you get when somebody's trying to argue with you in a relationship and those mixed emotions were, they're trying to confuse you and all you can do is say, "Listen, like I love you. There's no reason, there's no reason to argue--I'm just in love with you." And it was something that I was personally going through and now I'm happy to share it with the world.

Livin inside enclosed walls Got no money in my pockets No pictures on the walls Wake up with a gun on my head That's the life, the life I've lead What can I do?

In the end you know the life we live ñ Lays out on a grid ñ Point out peaks and curves ñ Down we spin ñ As I look upon my future self ñ I see a kind of hell ñ The parts I've tried to save ñ Are the ones I'll sell ñ As I age I see a dying light ñ In all our hopes and sacrifice ñ With one last gasp and a late embrace ñ The breath it took is the breath I take ñ I fight ñ With open eyes ñ Forced on the sun ñ My life ñ Will take a while ñ To hollow ñ They take my eyes last ñ With every new strike ñ I forget my past

Paid all my money, and what did I get? ñ Left here to smolder like some cigarette ñ I smoked every pack of lies made yet ñ I never read that little warning that said ñ  ñ I'd be an eternal soul with an eternal crave ñ Cashed every premium for this flip-top grave ñ When I locked my heart and threw away the key ñ Now I'm left with nothing ñ Nothing but me
But there is nothin' (nothin')
Painted ceilings, warmer feelings, winter windows ñ Inside of a house with three foot walls ñ Smaller details, nervousness tells little secrets ñ Like highschool crushes on a blank stare ñ Things that I keep in a safe place, notes that you wrote ñ Oh, I'd be sad if you don't care ñ Oh, I'd be sad if you don't care ñ Like highschool crushes on blank stare
Hey, Lionel Richie, ya ain't gettin' paid to dance. Why don't you get back to work? That's what I thought, ass
My Jean, My Jean, My Jean, My Jean, My love ñ I've crossed the line I feel alright ñ My Jean, My Jean, My Jean, My Jean, My love ñ Will you come home with me- tonight ñ I've never worn you, you've never worn me ñ I've never worn you, you've never worn me ñ My Jean, My Jean, My Jean, My Jean, My love ñ The fit is fine, I feel alright ñ My Jean, My Jean, My Jean, My Jean, My love ñ Will you come home with me tonight ñ I've never worn you, you've never worn me ñ I've never worn you, you've never worn me
I've got sunshine on a cloudy day ñ When it's cold outside ñ I've got the month of May ñ I guess you'd say ñ What can make me feel this way? ñ My girl ñ (My girl, my girl) ñ Talkin' 'bout my girl ñ (My girl) ñ I've got so much honey ñ The bees envy me ñ I've got a sweeter song ñ Than the birds in the trees ñ Well, I guess you'd say ñ What can make me feel this way? ñ My girl ñ (My girl, my girl) ñ Talkin' 'bout my girl ñ (My girl)
I walk along these streets until I Have you in my arms ñ Now that you're gone in my heart so wild and blue ñ And if I had the chance, I'd never let you go ñ And doll if you haven't called back, I'm begging you please ñ True Blue, baby ñ True Blue, for you ñ Forever and now ñ No matter how far the distances ñ I just want you to know ñ That my heart will always be true ñ True blue ñ For you ñ True blue ñ (incoherent) ñ True blue ñ True blue ñ True blue (for you babe)
Heading for the sun ñ In your quiet way ñ Like a ghost ñ Dressed in summer clothes ñ Take your time ñ Down that tender road ñ When you go ñ Across the lake ñ You'll still ñ Be out of place ñ Like a boat ñ Left out in the sand ñ Won't you be ñ On your own? ñ On your own? ñ Without a name ñ All alone ñ Won't you be ñ On your own? ñ On your own? ñ Without a name ñ All alone
Thank you for everything ñ Every moment you shared ñ I appreciated your stay ñ Every smile you gave away ñ Thank you for leaving ñ Now I clearly see the dark ñ Embraced by agony ñ I fear nothing but life ñ What's the reason to live if I cannot love ñ I can't get over you ñ What's the reason to live at all
Musetta! O joy of my abode! ñ Is it then true that you are now far away? ñ Is it then true that I have just driven you ñ Away ñ And that I will never hold you to ñ My ehart again? ñ Adored head, no more will you return ñ To rest happy on my pillow! ñ White little hands that I warmed on my heart ñ No more will my lips be able to kiss you! ñ Merry songs of the days of love ñ Your echo has already flown far away ñ The room is silent and my bereaved heart ñ Mourns in tedium those lost days! ñ Those lost days!
Arbitrary is the way ñ To a man who ñ Shines of death ñ And Hel-shod makes his steps ñ Wide the bridge ñ All of life - resting ñ All of life - glimmering
As the last ship sailed towards the distant horizon ñ I sat there watching on a rock ñ My mind slowly drifting away ñ Forming into my... Dreamtale
NO Diddy clothing line ain't on
It don't mean a thing ñ If it ain't got that swing ñ It don't mean a thing ñ All you gotta do is sing ñ It don't mean a thing ñ If it ain't got that swing ñ It don't mean a thing ñ All you gotta do is sing ñ It makes no difference if it's sweet or hot ñ Just give that rhythm ñ Given everything you got ñ It don't mean a thing ñ If it ain't got that swing ñ It don't mean a thing ñ All you gotta do is sing ñ It makes no difference if it's sweet or hot ñ Just give that rhythm ñ Given everything you got
A better place we go to ñ Without a trace we will leave ñ A new face we will see ñ A warm embrace we will receive ñ Those in front of me ñ Those among the world ñ Far away ñ A better world we go to ñ Those in time, time times two ñ Stars above, stars below ñ And what is man?
Everyfuckintime lad ñ 'Cause I had to hit the rhyme lad ñ I'm the best la' yeah la'
Beautiful Dreamer, wake unto me ñ Starlight and dewdrops are waiting for thee ñ Sounds of the rude world heard in the day ñ Lull'd by the moonlight have all passed away ñ  ñ Beautiful dreamer, queen of my song ñ List while I woo thee with soft melody ñ Gone are the cares of life's busy throng ñ Beautiful dreamer, awake unto me ñ Beautiful dreamer, awake unto me

Don't you care for the scars you hold? ñ Left to bear and the skies won't hold
Why do they hate me ñ What did I do to them ñ They always tried to break me ñ One time I called them friends ñ And now the years go by ñ And everyone leads a different life ñ They look at me and my beliefs ñ Tell me to my face I'm a different guy ñ What happened to Joe ñ The guy I used to know
This morning I read all the bad news ñ Front and back you know through and through ñ Now the inks all over my hands ñ Won't wash off, I don't understand ñ Please, please no more ñ Please, please, please no more ñ Day in and day out ñ I shake my head in doubt ñ At least Sunday's got fashion and style ñ But I just read the funny pages awhile ñ Please, please no more ñ Please, please, please no more ñ Please no more
You know it causes more problems you're not happy at all ñ Every time you indulge you realize you fall ñ All that you've learned don't take the wrong turn ñ If you keep it up you're gonna get burned ñ KEEP IT UP Go ahead KEEP IT UP KEEP IT UP II hope you don't KEEP IT UP ñ A position of respect live up to it ñ You never liked the trend, that's why you quit ñ You know what is wrong you know that you're strong ñ You knew the whole time that you didn't belong ñ KEEP IT UP
The snakes will wait to put their hands on me ñ Stripped me of my limbs when I was weak ñ You want it served it on a plate for you ñ I see the truth ñ And now your world is slipping ñ Cause crooks die slow ñ Another enemy wants to see me bleed ñ I see you're weak and now your world is slipping ñ Cause crooks die slow ñ These crooks surrounding me ñ They wanna see me bleed ñ They'll never make fucking dent in me
My old friend in crisis ñ Sleepwalks through windows ñ Be your own anchor ñ Your own home ñ Celebrity ñ Is beign as asshole ñ I imagine that ñ I'm my own ancestor ñ I'm quitting art ñ Hard up for expression ñ It's no problem to ñ Entertain these motherfuckers ñ I'll find balance ñ I can't give up enough
It's death to the U.S.A ñ It's death to the U.S.A ñ Where is the underground? ñ Could it be surfacing? ñ Maybe like Carol Durant? ñ Maybe like Sister Buck? ñ It's death to the U.S.A ñ It's death to the U.S.A ñ I suspect the underground ñ Says I support the Weather Underground ñ It's not for the hell of it ñ It's to tear this fuckin' nation down ñ It's death to the U.S.A ñ It's death to the U.S.A ñ It's death to the U.S.A ñ It's death to the U.S.A ñ It's death to the U.S.A
"Garunga" ñ We're searching "garunga" 'till the end of our time ñ We sail and suffer for our life of crime
Don't change the way you are. Don't change the way you were because I said ñ Run away from your mistakes and all you hate because you said. So you will ñ That's a promise you need to keep and if you break it, you'll never leave
I love you son ñ Whatever you become ñ What's right for one ñ Is not right for everyone ñ Follow your heart ñ Be true from the start ñ I love you some ñ Whatever you become
Chill out, slow yourself down ñ Turn your life around ñ Round hole or a square pen ñ Turn down the noise in your head ñ Who controls you now? ñ As you hit the ground ñ Round hole or a square pen ñ Turn down the noise in your head ñ The noise in your head ñ It's all in your head
From the mind of a convict, to the purity of a child ñ He sits in solitude, his imagination running wild ñ What is he to do now, now that he trapped ñ In a world of disbelief never to come back? ñ Have you ever thought ñ You could die by the words that someone said? ñ Do you believe the lies ñ Do you believe what they said ñ Comments about your life, things that you have done ñ Don't walk away, you've gotta turn and face the Son
Oh, the good life, full of fun ñ Seems to be the ideal ñ Yes, the good life let's you hide ñ All the sadness you feel ñ You won't really fall in love ñ For you can't take the chance ñ So be honest with yourself ñ Don't try to fake romance ñ It's the good life ñ To be free and explore the unknown ñ Like the heartaches ñ When you learn you must face them alone ñ Please remember, I still love you ñ And in case you don't know ñ Well, just wake up ñ Kiss the good life "hello"
Hey-hey-hey-hey, hey-hey-hey-hey, hey-hey-hey-hey you ñ Hey-hey-hey-hey, hey-hey-hey-hey, hey-hey-hey-hey you ñ Hey you ñ Hey-hey-hey-hey, hey-hey-hey-hey, hey-hey-hey-hey you ñ Hey-hey-hey-hey, hey-hey-hey-hey, hey-hey-hey-hey you ñ Hey you, hey you, hey you ñ Hey-hey-hey-hey, hey-hey-hey-hey, hey-hey-hey-hey you ñ Hey-hey-hey-hey, hey-hey-hey-hey, hey-hey-hey-hey you ñ You, you, you, you, you, you, you, yeah you, yeah you, yeah you
Fellas, can I go the bridge? (Yeah!) ñ The bridge? (Yeah!) ñ Hit it! ñ C'mon ñ  ñ Get on the scene, like a sex machine ñ Get on the scene, like a sex machine ñ Hit it and quit it ñ Hit it and quit it ñ Hit it and quit it ñ Hit me out!
It feels like there's nothing I can do ñ It feels like there's nothing left to do ñ Always feels like I must ñ Wait ñ Just a while ñ Because "anything worth having is worth the wait" ñ So it seems ñ That this waiting's left us somewhere in-between ñ It feels like there's nothing I can do ñ It feels like there's nothing left to do ñ Blind ambition is overrated ñ Apathetic bored and jaded now ñ You forget something ñ I wanted to be left alone
At least you tried ñ That's more than anyone around you ñ And if you lied ñ Would it fade out of your memory ñ Wishing it all away from you ñ Wishing is all you'll ever do ñ Wish I was here with you ñ Then I'd be fine ñ And if you died ñ Would they gather all around you ñ And if you cried ñ Would it wash away your misery ñ It's worse at night ñ Spirits flying all around you ñ Without the light ñ They can take away your sanity ñ CHORUS
Warming like a planet's core ñ Enormous heart with a pointless cause ñ Ginormous art without a meaning ñ To create and judge could be deceiving ñ On which pillar to which I'm leaning ñ I hate to pause, why not resume it ñ Hope consuming does the proving ñ Be it so ñ The battle's own and we're all losing ñ The villains win, I'm unassuming ñ Underdogs all win in movies ñ When honest words are spoke truly ñ There's nothing wrong with solely moving
Hey ñ  ñ Well, if you guessin' it's me, you guessed correctly, I just ñ Stay with a stallion, you would swear I was an equestrian ñ And um, I'ma hit her with that ****, call that Nancy Kerrigan ñ Stay on the greenest greens, call us vegetarians ñ You be on that minor league, but we smoke **** professionally ñ I do my job exceptionally, on point like a decimal is ñ The ride on the beat, man, I beat on the street ñ It's done so effortlessly ñ Yeah, so **** this, can't sleep on me ñ There's no Inception in this
Back from my tour, I'm a ñ Think of, think of ñ Think of, of, of, of ñ I think of, think of ñ Think of, think of ñ Think of, think of, think of, think of ñ Think of, think of, think of, think

Curse what you once lived for embrace the truant inside you ñ Forget the better life ñ Rot in your own backyard ñ Kill for a future ñ Dig up whats left ñ Give my life for one tomorrow ñ Find a way to make this fleeting rampage last ñ Another desolate city ñ Deadly streets, dark destinations ñ But we have no reflections anyway ñ Focus upon focus ñ Keep every ray of sunlight out ñ Stab every distraction through the heart ñ Let go, let go ñ Cut the hands of all who threaten ñ Let no one drag you under ñ Refuse to heal
So ñ Here we at ñ With no one ñ In the team ñ So ñ Here we are ñ With nothing ñ To believe
As I close my eyes a dream comes to me of the wind blowing leaves ñ And whisper to me oh yeah ñ Chorus ñ Ooh said it should've never been this way now we don't wanna go back ñ To the way we were the way we were ñ Beneath her lonely soul her heart has turned to stone because of the things ñ We do and we don't wanna change the things we do ñ Chorus ñ Ooh said it should've never been this way now we don't wanna go back ñ To the way we were the way we were
Out in the barnyard, the chickens do their number ñ Out in the farmyard, the cook is chopping lumber, ooh ñ  ñ Jump in the pigpen, next time I'll take my shoes off ñ Hit the dirt, do two-and-a-half, next time I'll leave my hat on
I sit alone looking in the mirror ñ I wish to god I was Craig Kilborn ñ I wanna I wanna look like him ñ I wanna I wanna sass like him ñ Cuz everybody knows he gets all the girls ñ And everybody knows he has the best hair in the world, in the world ñ A Whitney Brown A whitney Brown, Yea he's pretty cool ñ And that sexy sexy Beth chick ñ She makes me drool GO, but craig ñ Makes Ted Koppel look like a pansy ñ Jeanine Garfolo wants his weanie ñ Don't ever go and cut your hair! Don't ever cut your hair! ñ Fla na na na na na
I wanna change the way the world effects me ñ I wanna dance in the face of all that could be
From the land of loveless ñ Knowledge born of darkness ñ Mine forest burned to the ground ñ Burned to the floor long ago ñ Cutting the night from mine heart ñ Basking silent in hatred ñ Rinsing ñ Rising ñ Proselytized to the hatred ñ Steal on the thiever ñ Bearer of six hundred and sixty-six diseases ñ Fuck, with the night, into mine heart ñ Cut, with the night, into mine heart
My holiday heart I don't know where to start ñ I could keep you in remission ñ Or I could play the part ñ And when will you see ñ I complete you and reinvent you ñ And now ñ Holiday heart the very best part ñ I miss you with my holiday heart
Save me now ñ Before my world falls ñ Save me now ñ From myself before the dawn ñ Save me now ñ Before my world falls ñ Save me now ñ From myself before the dawn ñ Save me now ñ I'm at the reaper's door ñ Can't you see ñ You hold the key to set my mind free? ñ Save me now ñ I'm at the reaper's door ñ Can't you see ñ You hold the key to set my mind free?
For a while I had a magical intricacy going through ? ñ I was going six o'clock, leaving the house into the exciting darkness ? ñ I was just doing a project...
Lyrics From Snippet ñ  ñ Don't  know where I'm goin' (yeah), but I'm runnin' 'round L.A. in a foreign ñ Too much money gettin' made everyday, it's gettin' borin' (It's gettin' borin' now) ñ This the type of love that I need (That I need right now) ñ Live for this shit, die, sweat, then I bleed (I'ma bleed right now) ñ I don't feel shit cause I'm high off the weed (Off the weed right now) ñ You the girl that  I want and I need (Need you right now) ñ How the fuck you carryin' another nigga seed? (Yeah)
I kill a verse ñ I kill a... ñ H-U-R-T, they hate you I see ñ I got my gun with me, put it on P ñ 1-800 King Keef if you want some beef ñ Hurt, hurt, hurt ñ Pull up skurt, skurt, skurt ñ And you niggas hurt, hurt, hurt ñ Do your heart hurt? 'Cause my gun hurt
The cat sharpens its claws ñ And runs into the cornfields ñ Children playing hide and seek ñ A frail figure dressed in a cape ñ Wandering with measured steps ñ Haunted by derisive words ñ They want to capture the ogress ñ Wandering aimlessly ñ Finding pebbles on the ground ñ Picking leaves from an oaktree ñ Stalks make rents in green sails ñ Have some candy ñ She says ñ Far beneath the raging sea ñ Lies a monstrous vessel ñ Chained men singing elegies
Why did it get so dark ñ I can't bear it no more ñ Oh, I crumble ñ At the foot of love ñ The master of my pain ñ And my kingdom is fallin' ñ Oh my Kingdom ñ Oh is fallin' ñ Why did the light fade ñ Oh it hurts so bad ñ These stones I throw ñ Broke this heart of glass ñ And my kingdom's gone ñ And my will won't be gone ñ And I can't come back ñ Until the morning sun ñ I feel  ñ I can't deal with it ñ Oh, I can't deal with it
Bye, bye, bye ñ The time has come round again, my friend ñ A life and some time I just gotta spend ñ So bye bye, my friend ñ See you again ñ My mind in my pocket ñ The sun in my eye ñ There's gold in the mountains ñ The streams run by ñ So see you again ñ Swing low, swing high ñ Talk of the times, the love and the laughing ñ I'll come back to you in the spring, little lapwing ñ 'Till then, bye bye
Gangsters on the corner ñ Dem all fire gunshot ñ Police in adem uniform ñ They fire shots back ñ Innocent bystanders ñ Bite the bullet once again ñ With laws full of discrepancy ñ It's only us to blame ñ You say you want to work it out ñ Yet stick a gun into my mouth ñ An then you calmly shout ñ This worlds at peace ñ I shaully doubt ñ I see no equal rights or justice only ñ Pain ñ Dats running in your vain ñ Man made pain ñ An it's only us to blame ñ Oh well ñ The activists there on a mental rampage
You always sleep better ñ When you don't have any dreams ñ (But what a nightmare that would be)
There's a land of promise ahead ñ Though now it's far away ñ Journey with all of our friends ñ To a place that we can stay ñ So leave all your worries behind ñ  ñ Because new life awaits us ñ (?) ñ Fields that are green ñ (Moja kwa moja) ñ Keep moving forward ñ (?) ñ Hard as it seems ñ (Twendeni safari) ñ A new road to freedom ñ (?) ñ Let's follow the sun ñ (Moja kwa moja) ñ On a trail to hope ñ (Trail to hope) ñ We've only begun ñ (?) ñ (Harambee, harambee) ñ (Moja kwa moja) ñ We've only begun ñ (?) ñ (Harambee) ñ (Hum...)
You fuck me up and let me go ñ Your bitterness has gotten old ñ  ñ You're so cold ñ You're so cold ñ You're so cold ñ  ñ You are a stranger when I come home ñ You'll never turn your dreams to gold ñ  ñ You're so cold ñ You're so cold ñ You're so cold
Smash me into little pieces, put me in a cup ñ Add sugar, stir me, warm me up, and drink me ñ I want to get inside you.I want to light your heart ñ I want to lick your secret valleys, slide through alleys ñ (dance from stone to stone?) ñ I want to hear you moan in ecstasy.You're shy, you shouldn't be ñ I just want to get to know you better, to know you better, know you better ñ I'm a curious guy.(x3)I spy ñ There's blood in my eyes ñ I'm a furious guy.(x2)I die ñ (I'm great in cans; I'm great on toast........)
Don't you worry ñ Don't you moan ñ We're all living in a casualty zone ñ Drink yourself silly ñ Were you a victim of your own neurosis? ñ Did you band your head? ñ Are you accident prone? ñ Name your poison. Is it your religion? ñ Name your poison. Drowned in the system ñ Got you on a misdemeanor ñ Don't want no derogatory remarks ñ So we are the dregs of your society ñ Disenfranchised we fell through the net ñ Name your poison. Practice your religion ñ Name your poison. Bow to the system
Then was then ñ And now is now ñ Don't look back ñ You can't look back somehow ñ Sweet was sweet ñ But not so bitter now ñ Then was then ñ And now is now ñ You forgive ñ And I will too ñ Let's forget ñ Unhappy times we knew ñ We'll come out ñ All shiny, bright and new ñ Then was then ñ And now is now ñ Now, now we can win ñ No matter what might have been ñ Now we can begin again ñ For then was then ñ And now is now
Why should I feel discouraged ñ And why must the shadows come ñ Tell me why should my heart feel lonely ñ And long for heaven and home ñ When Jesus is, is my portion? ñ A constant Friend is He ñ His eye is on ñ On the sparrow ñ And I know He watches me ñ I sing because I'm happy ñ I sing because, 'cause I'm free, oh ñ His eye is on the sparrow ñ And I know he watches over ñ Yes, he watches me, yeah
Feary dreams while a feary night ñ The memories you have to fight ñ Don't be a fool when it's time to die ñ This is the place where we all have to cry ñ Insomnia! ñ What do you feel when you march through the streets ñ Can't you hear the alien heartbeat ñ I don't wonder why you can't sleep at night ñ If I had your mind I would go suicide
I like the night flights best with the cabin lights out, the cities below seems as bright as the stars. a tapestry of glow worms in gridlock, i look for the landmarks and try not to let myself work out where you are. i might as well be an organ in your body, the damage i do when i do nothing. i might as well be an organ in your body, i'm tied to your senses, i can feel when your muscles tense
Drugstore carnivore ñ A bit too curious ñ Can't get up ñ Can't get down ñ The elevator's on a distant floor ñ Stuttering through the turnstile ñ With the meathook of a pedophile ñ But there's no crime ñ Just a meeting for a meathook manicure
Here I stand ñ Here I stand ñ An explosion of fire ñ Here I am ñ Here I am ñ An ocean's desire ñ Standing on the edge ñ Standing on the edge ñ Standing on the edge ñ I'm on the side of the moon that always shines on you ñ I can see the whole world from here ñ But all I ever do is stare at you ñ I'm on the side, I'm on the side ñ I'm on the side of the moon ñ I'm on the side of the moon that always shines on ñ Shines on you ñ I am lost ñ I am lost ñ I don't wanna be found ñ There I stand ñ I can see that you're ñ Safe and sound
Allison ñ I'm sitting over here on Parchman farm ñ I'm sitting over here on Parchman farm ñ I'm sitting over here on Parchman farm ñ Ain't never done no man no harm ñ Well, I'm putting that cotton in a never-full sack ñ Well, I'm putting that cotton in a never-full sack ñ Well, I'm putting that cotton in a never-full sack ñ A twelve-gauge shotgun at my back ñ I'm sitting over here on Parchman farm ñ I'm sitting over here on Parchman farm ñ I'm sitting over here on Parchman farm ñ Ain't never done no man no harm
Chorus: ñ If you come home with me ñ Baby it's on tonight ñ As soon as you walk thru that door ñ (it's on) ñ It's on tonight ñ You be the fore and let me play ñ (foreplay) ñ Just 'till we get it right ñ 'cause when I set the mood ñ The way you like ñ It's on tonight ñ Bridge: ñ Well here we are ñ Let's take it nice & slow ñ Here we are ñ Just makin' love ñ Baby we'll be awhile ñ Because I will always ñ Make sweet love to you ñ It's on it's on it's on it's on tonight
And I often sigh ñ I often wonder why ñ I'm still here and I still cry ñ  ñ And I often cry ñ I often spill a tear ñ Over those not here ñ But still they are so near ñ  ñ Please ease my burden ñ  ñ And I still remember ñ A memory and I weep ñ In my broken sleep ñ The scars they cut so deep ñ  ñ Please ease my burden ñ Please ease my pain ñ  ñ Surely without war there would be no loss ñ Hence no mourning, no grief, no pain, no misery ñ No sleepless nights missing the dead... Oh, no more ñ No more war
The element of occultism and the ñ Power to deceive ñ The Freemasonic government we worship ñ Spreading this disease ñ The occult hidden obscured from view ñ How divine is depopulation ñ A true society that fades into history ñ Brotherhood of Saturn ñ Thrones of the violent ñ Spreading an illness ñ Men of the order ñ The Bay of Pigs ñ An invasion of failures ñ Brotherhood of illness ñ Throne of the violent ñ Spreading an illness ñ Saturn Brotherhood
It's never been this cold before ñ Now it's getting to me ñ Writing my thoughts home to you ñ So wake the regiment ñ We're marching on tonight ñ This is what we live for, this is what we live for ñ So wake the regiment ñ We're taking back what's ours ñ Home is what we die for, home is what we die for ñ Now memories of yesteryear ñ They're enough to get me through just one more time ñ I'm thinking about you and all the things that you've taught me in this life ñ I'll remember till I die
Things seem to work out when you think they never will ñ And often things burn down that you tried to build so high ñ Friendships come and go and most relationships will die ñ I know it's hard to move on, but that's love and that's life ñ You can't change me, i won't believe your ugly lies ñ You won't spare me, i've got better things to do
I didn't know that this fuse was for the end of it all ñ With a grin and a flame I watch the glory ñ With my back pressed against the wall and my face six feet from the ground ñ A smile escapes ñ Because my closet holds no bones
Rising affliction in an age ñ Of cataclysmic war ñ In desolation, no flesh is saved ñ Biomechanic automatic A.I. lifeform ñ The fate decided, the pain so great ñ Deliver me ñ Divine correction coming ñ From your new rival god ñ Pray for forgiveness where there is none ñ Biomechanic automatic A.I. lifeform ñ Your fate is given, your hope is none
(Kelly/Mann) ñ I never liked a bleeding heart ñ But a bleeding heart's what I've become ñ With a broken funny bone ñ And a rubber crutch to lean upon ñ How can I turn from this mistake? ñ How can I bend? I know you'll break ñ When you love so willingly ñ Love so willingly ñ Love so willingly ñ Love me ñ I'm never one for casting doubt ñ But a shadow maker I've become ñ The placard held above my head ñ I can't recall just what it said

In the morning ñ On your journey here to the sea ñ In the mountains ñ Your shadows beside me ñ You cross the pasture land ñ And threw your wedding band ñ Into the great deep ñ Where you'd rest to sleep ñ My dear ñ My dear ñ In the oceans where you lay ñ Where you've made your grave ñ They'll found you on the shore ñ Rosy no more ñ My dear ñ My dear ñ In the morning on your journey here to the sea ñ You crossed the pasture land ñ And threw your wedding band ñ Swallowing the seed ñ Of truth

I wonder as I wander out under the sky ñ How Jesus my Saviour did come for to die ñ For poor on'ry people like you and like I ñ I wonder as I wander out under the sky ñ I wonder as I wander out under the sky ñ That Jesus my Saviour did come for to die ñ For poor on'ry people like you and like I ñ I wonder as I wander out under the sky ñ  ñ  ñ I wonder as I wander out under the sky

Jeepers, creepers, where'd ya get those peepers ñ Jeepers, creepers, where'd ya get those eyes? ñ Gosh all, git up, how'd they get so lit up ñ Gosh all, git up, how'd they get that size? ñ Golly gee! When you turn those heaters on ñ Woe is me, got to put my cheaters on ñ Jeepers, creepers, where'd ya get those peepers? ñ Oh, those weepers, how they hypnotize! ñ Where'd ya get those eyes?
Where are they now? ñ They are gone ñ I saw them run ñ Run to the sea ñ Under the waves ñ All has been said ñ Can you hear them? ñ Their voices are free ñ Free from the sun stare ñ Free from the noise ñ Of lost souls... ñ In exiled sound ñ Washed in with the tide ñ Their voices are free ñ Free from the sun stare ñ Free from the noise ñ Of lost souls... ñ Their voice carries life ñ Under the waves ñ Under the waves ñ Their voice carries life ñ Under the waves ñ Under the waves ñ Under the waves ñ Under the waves...

How does it measure up? ñ Was I good enough? ñ I'll never know... ñ And if it's meant to be ñ What will it mean to me? ñ Never want to know... ñ Always headstrong calling me home ñ There was a place I belong ñ And as I fill my cup ñ I wonder have I had enough? ñ And I'm not sure... ñ What will be, will be ñ Not without some mystery ñ That I'm sure... ñ Always headstrong calling me home ñ There was a place I belonged

Holy bravado ñ Tinsel Mikado ñ Waving from windows ñ Nobody you know ñ I needed to see you ñ Remember a feeling ñ Strange what the sun through the trees through the window ñ Can do to you ñ Holy bravado ñ Tinsel Mikado ñ Nobody you know ñ Sorry I called you ñ Sorry I called you ñ Someone who knew you
The distraction last a little while but the problem still remains ñ We're measuring our happiness in wealth and capital gains ñ We rose above our fathers, but our ethics hit the wall ñ We're taking all the shortcuts to appear we're twice as tall ñ But we are nothing, No one, Less than that if modest

Into the bush, I'm felling the rush ñ A taste for flesh, To drink the blood that's fresh ñ Dawn brings the sun its time to have some fun ñ Unsheathe my knife, ready to take a life ñ Exit wounds ñ The blade punctures through your weak skin ñ Blood runs steaming, smeared on my chin ñ Behold the flesh it makes an awful mess ñ The wounds have dried now I will take your hide ñ Remove the head a trophy of the dead ñ Not clear to see, it's an human taxidermy ñ Exit wounds
Whatcha know about this? ñ Everything I spit is X-rated ñ Let's face it, you just a baller, I'm  ñ Just hate it, when you say my name, play my game ñ  scream my name ñ Baby take it off, let me see some flesh ñ Squeeze them all night long, he no rest ñ We no stress
There she is among her children ñ Full of paintings ñ Going round and round the houses ñ Full of paintings, full of pictures ñ There she is not
Lost in the middle of the night ñ She's got no way to go ñ Doesn't need all anymore ñ The way she talks to me ñ In words i never spoking enough ñ My heart is broking ñ Doesn't need all anymore ñ She's not just a tipical girl from the mitical world ñ And she's running from all of the physical world ñ And she knows put heart but this heart is broken
When you walk through the storm ñ Hold you headd up high ñ And don't be afraid of the dark ñ At the end of the storm ñ There's a golden sky ñ And the sweet silver song of the lark ñ Walk on, through the wind ñ Walk on, through the rain ñ Though your dreams be tossed and blown ñ Walk on, walk on ñ With hope in your heart ñ And you'll never walk alone ñ And you'll never walk alone
Sitting at home at night i'm feeling alone ñ I get to thiking to myself ñ There was a time I wanted you by my side ñ Until I realised that you're all the same! ñ You can't tell us what to do ñ Coz we've done better things than you ñ You can't tell us what to do ñ At least we're ñ Morgan ñ Morgan ñ Morgan, yeah! ñ Morgan ñ You know we're spying for the FBI ñ Not something that you can boast about ñ You think that you're three steps ahead of us ñ One day we'll be 3 thousand kilometres away

I have seen the endless waves breaking ñ On my vessel's side ñ Ten thousand silver whales laboring ñ In the shifting tide ñ Now I near the bottom ñ Tangled in the mast ñ I go to meet the crewmen ñ On a thousand ships of glass ñ See the soldiers' bodies twisted ñ In the crimson snow ñ See the farmers' graves positioned ñ Neatly in their rows ñ No grave for the swallowed sailor ñ For fisherman and slaves ñ No grave for the swallowed whalers ñ Who whisper on the waves ñ Down I go ñ Down I go ñ Down to meet them all
Only in America ñ Only in America ñ I walk, I try to learn, I die ñ I walk, I try to learn, I die ñ Only in America ñ Only in America ñ I walk, I try to learn, I hide ñ I run, I try to breathe, I die ñ Only in America ñ Lonely in America ñ Homely in America ñ Lonely In America ñ America
Love, my love, O my, O my love ñ When this song is old and gray, will you stay my love, O my love ñ O won't you come on home, we miss you so much, we miss you so damn much
Your technicolour extravaganza ñ Has taken my attention ñ A gymnast and a painter ñ Unaware of my affection ñ Your patterns of beauty ñ Decorate the air ñ Your peacefulness and tranquility ñ With all of us you share ñ Dancing in the sunlight ñ Complimenting the day ñ Please, may painted lady ñ I wish for you to stay ñ Please, my painted lady ñ I wish to you to stay
Should I leave ñ Should I lay low ñ If I ask you ñ Will you even know ñ From the roof to the ground ñ These walls must come down ñ It all seems right written on page ñ I tell myself will be ok ñ But I can't chase away my doubt ñ So much left, to figure out ñ  ñ Weighted mind ñ Wasted time ñ  ñ Through the haze ñ See what you lose ñ A broken glass that never spills ñ I know you think you've been set free ñ But we are slaves ñ To our beliefs ñ  ñ Weighted mind ñ Wasted time ñ Weighted mind ñ Wasted time ñ Weighted minds ñ Wasted time

Intro ñ We want to go higher ñ We want to go deeper into you, Oh God ñ Oh take us to another place God ñ Take us to another dimension God ñ By your spirit and your glory ñ We want to experience you ñ In a new way ñ Take us to new realms in your glory ñ Another place ñ Another place ñ Another place ñ Take us to another place ñ We're in another place in Him ñ We're in another place in Him ñ (Repeated throughout the remainder of the song as the lead ad-libs)
This is a factory ñ We give you pride for a fee ñ By land or by sea, we will continue to be ñ I, I'll fight for mine ñ Get back to the center ñ I'll be the never ender ñ You always look for someone to blame ñ I will not play that game ñ Fear of pain means nothing to me ñ Your lack of heart is something to see ñ I wish that you would cease to breathe ñ I'll fight for mine, this you better believe ñ I shun your lack of heart ñ I think it's fucking pathetic ñ You should pray for rain ñ You should pray for rain
I'm gonna get your love, oh yeah

There you go ñ In and out again ñ Of my life ñ It happened once before ñ But you should know ñ I still feel the same ñ Just be yourself ñ In every way you are ñ You don't have to change ñ In every way you are ñ Time goes by ñ People come and go ñ But we remain ñ The way we used to be ñ Well, I saw you ñ Walk away from love ñ I need you so ñ In every way you are ñ You don't have to change ñ In every way you are
I think about You everyday ñ Thankful that You've washed my sins away ñ Knowing that it's love that brought me to Your side ñ I feel Your Spirit in my heart ñ Drawing me so ever close to You ñ Longing for the touch of You upon my life ñ All I know it's not by might or by my power ñ But it's by the Spirit of the Lord ñ Fill me now Holy One ñ Fill me to overflowing ñ Touch me now Worthy One ñ Your Power keeps me going ñ Breathe on me breath of life ñ I need You to fill me over ñ Come and breathe on me

Black midnight sun ñ Endless void appears ñ Dark shadow, purged eons ñ Death pulling you near ñ Dawn never comes ñ World falls undone ñ Night of no end ñ Burning black sun ñ Twelve arms unite ñ The killers of light ñ You are the birth ñ You are the rite ñ Burning cities fall ñ Far as eyes will see ñ No graves, no coffins ñ Bodies fill the street ñ Dawn never comes ñ World falls undone ñ Night of no end ñ Burning black sun ñ You are the birth ñ You are the rite ñ Destroy ñ Destroy ñ Return to nothing
Black rain falls from a velvet sky ñ Night time crawls thru my curtains ñ A shadow looms inside my head ñ Silent silence screams ñ And the night is crawling ñ Black rain falls from a velvet sky ñ My soul is poisoned ñ Alone I sleep in this bed of pain ñ 3.25 my mind is alive ñ The fridge hums a cold tune ñ Much like my heart ñ Frozen in part ñ Trying 2 thaw out a song ñ Blackened veils over sunken eyes ñ Despair pulses thru cold veins ñ Ill take your pain and raise you ñ A sorrow ñ Blackened eyes and broken hearts
Where did my friends go? ñ They went so far away ñ I asked them why but they said they could not stay ñ But when they came back I noticed that my friends had changed ñ I was up so high ñ With my feelings but I fell back to the floor ñ And when I came to I noticed, that my friend's they ñ Wanted nothing more to do with me... ñ Why have I gone away? ñ Why did I go away?
I and I bless the Lord ñ Give thanks and praises to the Lord ñ I and I bless the Lord ñ Give thanks and praises to the Lord ñ I and I bless the Lord ñ Give thanks and praises to the Lord ñ I and I bless the Lord ñ Give thanks and praises to the Lord ñ I and I bless the Lord ñ Give thanks and praises to the Lord
He's a man obsessed ñ He couldn't be a lover ñ So now he's a pest ñ He played the game ñ But he failed the test ñ He's a man obsessed ñ He's a pest ñ He's a man obsessed ñ She's strictly restricted ñ She's strictly business ñ And her business is death ñ He's a man obsessed ñ He's a pest ñ The only way you could get her to look at you is to die ñ Why don't you die? ñ He's a man obsessed ñ He couldn't be a lover ñ So now he's a pest ñ He played the game ñ But he failed the test ñ He's a man obsessed ñ He's a pest
In the next world war in a jackknifed juggernaut, I am born again ñ In the neon sign scrolling up and down, I am born again ñ In an interstellar burst I am back to save the universe ñ In a deep, deep sleep of the innocent, I am born again ñ In a fast German car I'm amazed that I survived, an airbag saved my life ñ In an interstellar burst I am back to save the universe ñ In an interstellar burst I am back to save the universe ñ In an interstellar burst I am back to save the universe
Warning Warning-forgot to mention my fear of falling ñ Warning Warning-the voice inside my head keeps calling ñ Warning Warning-the water's deep better learn to tread ñ Teetering on the edge ñ The voices inside my head-they're calling, they're calling ñ They echo the things you said ñ 311420

With blatant deception they rape the fields of life ñ With brutal destruction enforcing hatred and strife ñ They take beauty in their hands yet put back only pain ñ Their bigotry and greed has always been the same ñ With blind acceptance with swallow all their lies ñ Engulfe ñ D by their hatred we learn only to despise ñ They have nothing in their arrogance, their narrow minded stance ñ But they won't open up their eyes to even give it just a chance

You told yourself something funny the other day ñ You said you can't make you laugh ñ How can that be in your solid state? ñ How can that be in your solid state? ñ Don't say no, just say you don't know ñ How can that be in your solid state? ñ As you make it unreal ñ I'm reeling around the fountain ñ I'm reeling around the fountain ñ I still confide in you almost every day ñ Even though you're not around ñ How can that be in your solid state? ñ How can that be in your solid state? ñ Don't say no, just say you don't know
There's my favorite rollercoaster ñ Next to the blue water ñ The one only sissies ride ñ There's the sun going down ñ Creating that fluorescent glow ñ Reminding me I'll never be able ñ To relive this day ñ Except in memory ñ  ñ There's those big barking fish ñ In the concrete stream ñ Growling for dog food ñ Bulging dead eyes that gleam ñ But where's dad ñ And where is mom ñ  ñ Looks like from here on out ñ It's me and you ñ Looks like from here on out ñ It's just me and you

You say this guy's in love with you ñ Who looks at you the way I do? ñ Tell me now, but don't tell me ñ Know each other very well ñ My heart's racing to love ñ I need your love ñ Say you're in love, in love ñ With this guy ñ If not, I'll just die ñ You say this guy's in love with you ñ Who looks at you the way I do? ñ Tell me now, but don't tell me ñ Know each other very well ñ My heart's racing to love ñ My heart's racing to love

They all tell me I suck like Kurt Angle ñ Riot 'til that gun come out the hump ñ If you was smart you would duck ñ Duck goose with a slut, it's still two in the back ñ Still one in the front ñ My last gun in a month was a Remington Revolver ñ Fucking bummer how I didn't get to use it when I caught her ñ But anyway, I pulled the David Bowie out to skin her scalp ñ The sassy slut, just left half ñ And that's a motherfucking Cassie Cut ñ  ñ That's all you get hahaha ñ That's all you fucking get
Once you told me that in a dream ñ We bought a vase and a single flower ñ Brought it back to our house and place it on our table and said ñ "Finally, this is what I have been waiting for for so long" ñ I hide your dream foreshadowing future
I need your soul tonight ñ My animal ñ Not the body ñ Of your hidden beast ñ I need your heart tonight ñ My cannibal ñ Not the bloody ñ Vampirizing feast ñ Oh, give me, give me, give me ñ My human lover ñ The raw beauty of love ñ Tonight
Bittersweet memories cloud my faded mind ñ And if I was so lucky, I could press rewind ñ But could it be I'm crazy? ñ 'Cause I've been wrong before ñ Let a nigga know

Once, I was a prisoner ñ Lost inside myself ñ With the world surrounding me ñ Wandering through the misery ñ But now I am free ñ  ñ You gave me a breath of life ñ Unclouded my eyes ñ With a sweet serenity ñ Lighting a ray of hope for me ñ And now I am free ñ  ñ Free to live ñ Free to laugh ñ Free to soar ñ Free to shine ñ Free to give ñ Free to love ñ Free enough to fly ñ  ñ Once, I was all so alone ñ Unsteady and cold ñ But your love rained down upon me ñ Washing away uncertainty, yeah, yeah ñ  ñ But now ñ I am free ñ I am free
As you're drowning further hold me close ñ Take my all and never let me go ñ Even in the deepest water ñ Even in the deep ñ As we dive into the black unknown ñ Take my all and never let me go ñ Even in the deepest water ñ Even in the deep ñ Even in the deep ñ Deep, deep, deep, deep, deep ñ As you're drowning further hold me close ñ Take my all and never let me go
Why am I cold, so devoid? ñ And why do I feel what I am? ñ Destroyed, all you bestowed ñ You're my all ñ I am ñ It falls apart ñ They recede ñ Oh, how I envy them ñ How I long ñ Everything I was is dead ñ Oh, how I long ñ Mine ñ In this lie ñ This is me ñ In this lie ñ I drown ñ I fall ñ I subside ñ Why do I feel?
What can I do right now ñ What can I do right now ñ What can I do right now ñ What can I do right now ñ What can I do today ñ I am so bored right now ñ So I don't know what to do ñ Maybe I should stop singing
I'm immature, I talk a lot ñ I'm a lying, cheating little snot ñ I smell bad, I don't comb my hair ñ I steal from work, I don't fight fair ñ I can't stand myself ñ I can't stand myself ñ Girls are repulsed by the sight of me ñ I slouch and I don't brush my teeth ñ Don't have a job, don't go to school ñ And worst of all, I think I'm cool ñ I can't stand myself ñ I can't stand myself
The Quickening repowers me!
Control the power, leave the ground ñ As fast as an arrow up to the clouds, into the sky ñ Man and machine are becoming one ñ A perfect day for changing the face of the world ñ Go for glory, for hope and for God ñ They break the clouds, reach for the sky ñ Like hunters in an ancient story ñ They are the brave sons of the wind ñ Become a hero, pay the price ñ The need for speed is overwhelming your heart ñ The harvest of honour has begun ñ Live for the moment, leave all your worries behind
Crawl into our churches ñ Beneath feels to fuck ñ Candles light the way ñ  ñ London 13 demon street  ñ See the laughter witch ñ Beyond the hallowed name ñ Read by Devil silence ñ Bloodgutter in all day ñ London 13 demon street  ñ Be our next victim, call in strings of blood ñ Tortured forth by satanic sex ñ Salvation is at hand, Prepare to be slaved ñ Crawl into our churches ñ Beneath feels to fuck ñ Candles light the way ñ London 13 demon street 
Put it in your pocket, leave it in your shoe ñ Plug it in your socket, flush it down the loo ñ Hey baby, show me something new ñ Put it in your hat, put it in your can ñ Feed it to your cat, share it with your band ñ Hey baby, help me understand ñ Well they're fighting in the kitchen and they're fighting in the hall ñ Up against the dark and up against the wall ñ Why don't you meet me in the bottom, baby; bring your running shoes
It felt like any other day ñ Everything was going great ñ I was standing still ñ Until the heatwave ñ Now I'm face down on the floor ñ I just can't understand what for ñ Officer told me it's a raid ñ Can't stop the heatwave
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas ñ Just like the ones I used to know ñ Where the treetops glisten ñ And children listen ñ To hear sleigh bells in the snow ñ I'm dreaming of a white Christmas ñ With every Christmas card I write ñ May your days be merry and bright ñ And may all your Christmases be white ñ I'm dreaming of a white Christmas ñ With every Christmas card I write ñ May your days be merry and bright ñ And may all your Christmases be white

Goodnight my friends ñ Goodnight my friends ñ Sweet dreams from ABC land
Too many people about ñ Telling me what to do with myself ñ It's hard to get around ñ Walking on soft, soft ground ñ Well they can say what they feel ñ 'Cause I'm completely foreign ñ I know it's clear ñ It's putting my mind, my mind at ease ñ She's reliable, but demanding ñ She orders me about ñ She often keeps on wanting ñ Till the morning light is out ñ Too many mouths ñ Arguing over nothing at all ñ Its hard to get around ñ Walking on soft, soft ground
No one washed behind my ears ñ High in the trees alone for years ñ Practicing my solitary scales 'til they rose like balloons ñ Watching them go where they will go ñ  ñ Face in the leaves, song in my throat ñ Fall through the air, hoping to float ñ Practicing my solitary scales 'til they grow heavy ñ Too heavy to carry ñ Watching them go where they will go
This gravity ñ Is feeling like a tether ñ I want to want to be ñ So high above the weather ñ All frequency around ñ Round, round, round, round ñ Without a sound ñ And there's today ñ And there's two spaces ñ And too many places ñ Not to go to, ooh ñ This big old sea ñ Is feeling like a pleasure ñ I look cautiously ñ At all the falling treasure ñ With some frequency it comes down ñ Down, down, down, down ñ Without a sound ñ And there's today ñ And there's two spaces ñ And too many places ñ Not to go to, ooh
Look down, look down that lonesome road ñ Hang down your head and cry ñ The best of friends must part someday ñ And why not you and I ñ I wish to God that I had died ñ Had died fore I was born ñ Before I seen your smiling face ñ And heard your lying tongue

I was put away ñ 'cause I could not play ñ This game called system of today ñ Doctor wished me best of luck ñ Told me I'm insane as f**k
So as we stare into the sun ñ Our corneas melt into one ñ And pour like liquid down our cheeks ñ And I'm forgetting how to breathe ñ I can't relax, my body churns ñ Ninety percent of gamma burns ñ My head is throbbing, feeling weak ñ From radioactivity ñ As blackened ash clogs up the sky ñ One by one, babies stop to cry ñ And now I feel it in my bones ñ And now I feel like letting go ñ Goodbye ñ Goodbye ñ Goodbye ñ Goodbye

Wakin' up feelin' good and limber ñ When the telephone it ring ñ Was a bad man from California ñ Tellin' of a stone he'd bring ñ And of better days ñ From this town, we'd escape ñ If we holler loud and make our way ñ We'd all live one big holiday ñ So we listened and up the river ñ And recorded all the sounds ñ Was some shakin' and some record playin' ñ All the leather kids were loud

I see a pear falling down from the tree ñ Winter is coming and it's plain to see ñ I spend the cold nights in my lonely room ñ Is it the winter to which I am doomed? ñ Cold is the snow that will cover the ground ñ I feel the presence of tears falling down ñ Is it for pity or pain that I cry? ñ Color is gone and the grass it must die ñ Winter brings sadness that empties my soul ñ Life is too short for a dog growing old ñ He used to follow and play at my heels ñ Love from his heart I no longer can feel
Open your eyes, it's time to begin ñ A lesson in lies from fair-weather friends ñ So let's take a drive, the road never ends ñ With so many miles between us again ñ And if they come by, don't let 'em in ñ I'm weary but wise of fair-weather friends ñ So don't be surprised, the places we've been ñ Or how many miles between us again
World inside of me, I know ñ The forest and the trees, I know ñ The cars upon my street won't go ñ I know ñ Be a light to all, you shine ñ Into darker lands, you shine ñ A friend to friendless men, you shine ñ You shine ñ Star of land and sea, lead me ñ Into morning sun, lead me ñ Star of land and Star of sea, lead me ñ Lead me

Afraid to dream ñ Benny Goodman ñ Afraid to dream, afraid that you may not be there ñ Afraid to dream, without you it would seem so bare ñ With open arms I call to you, I want you, dear ñ Just as I reach for you, why do you disappear? ñ Afraid to dream; I'll see you there with someone new ñ Afraid to find another one caressing you ñ Although you promised me that this could never be ñ It's the thought of losing you that makes me so afraid to dream
There really is a town called Hopeless ñ On a faded map circled in blue ñ Boy thrown bottle of highway bridge ñ Lost men driving in circles ñ I got wheels ñ I followed that big sign out of here ñ Left with a box I still cannot find ñ A boy holding out his empty hand ñ Young man kicking himself down an unconscious street ñ There really is a town called Hopeless ñ On a faded map circled in blue ñ Young man spinning off an icy bridge ñ Boy drawing himself in the driver's seat ñ I got wheels
There are some men ñ who should have mountains ñ to bear their names to time. ñ Grave-markers are not high enough ñ or green, ñ and sons go far away ñ to lose the fist ñ their father's hand will always seem. ñ I had a friend: ñ he lived and died in mighty silence ñ and with dignity, ñ left no book, son, or lover to mourn. ñ Nor is this a mourning-song ñ but only a naming of this mountain ñ on which I walk, ñ fragrant, dark, and softly white ñ under the pale of mist. ñ I name this mountain after him.
Just you, just me ñ Let's find a cozy spot ñ To cuddle and coo ñ Just us, just we ñ I've missed an awful lot ñ My trouble is you ñ Oh, gee! ñ What are your charms for? ñ What are my arms for? ñ Use your imagination! ñ Just you, just me ñ I'll tie a lover's knot ñ 'Round wonderful you!

The divine mother stumbles ñ Cancer wrapped around her heart ñ The eyes of gods kept ñ Infect fingers pry open the clearest cages ñ Sickness has been made ñ Father and sons ñ Stoic fire ñ Sisters tears protect ñ There is no fear ñ The eyes of god kept ñ Measures have been taken ñ Wipe clean my face ñ Rip clear my heart ñ Death must seem so distant ñ That reach has not reached me:
Have yourself a merry little Christmas ñ Let your heart be light ñ From now on our troubles will be out of sight ñ Have yourself a merry little Christmas ñ Make the Yule-tide gay ñ From now on our troubles will be miles away ñ Here we are as in olden days ñ Happy golden days of yore ñ Faithful friends who are dear to us ñ Gather near to us once more ñ Through the years we all will be together ñ If the Lord allows ñ Hang that shining star on the highest bough ñ And have yourself a merry little Christmas now

Mother, I feel so cold, she says and stares into the dark ñ I take hold of her hands ñ She`s burning like fire ñ I have seen the lilies bloom on a cold winter day ñ I have heard dead men speak ñ And wash their sins away ñ No more shall I fear the night ñ I have seen it all ñ I`d give away my heart and soul if only that could bring her back to life ñ She was fair, like light and day ñ She was my heart`s delight ñ She says no-one`s to blame ñ But indeed I blame myself
Love is a burning thing ñ And it makes a firery ring ñ Bound by wild desire ñ I fell in to a ring of fire... ñ I fell in to a burning ring of fire ñ I went down, down, down ñ And the flames went higher ñ And it burns, burns, burns ñ The ring of fire ñ The ring of fire ñ The taste of love is sweet ñ When hearts like ours meet ñ I fell for you like a child ñ Oh, but the fire went wild ñ I fell in to a burning ring of fire.....
I need your love so badly ñ I love you oh so madly ñ But I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you ñ I thought at last I found you ñ But other loves surround you ñ And I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you ñ If you'd surrender ñ Just for a tender ñ Kiss or two ñ You might discover ñ That I'm the lover ñ Meant for you ñ And I'd be true ñ But what's the good of scheming ñ I'm dreaming ñ For I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you ñ 'cause I don't stand ñ A ghost of a chance ñ With you
I need someone, one heart to beat ñ Ride alongside my own, I need someone to believe ñ That I will fight, till the day ñ I will fight, all the way ñ I will fight ñ Lord knows I won't stop, until my heart gives way ñ And I don't believe in fairytales no more, but I still believe in me ñ I don't believe in forever, but I could use some company ñ Still I will fight, till the day ñ I will fight, all the way ñ I will fight ñ Lord knows I won't stop, until my heart gives way
Ask me why I look so sad ñ They've taken everything I have ñ Left with my dreams ñ And the setting sun ñ And tasted that these ñ Were the things to come ñ They lie through their teeth ñ But it's coming uncovered ñ They've gotten their chances ñ But won't get another ñ It's all wrong ñ Ask me why I look so mad ñ They've fucked up every thing I have ñ I still have my dreams ñ And the setting sun ñ And hope for the beings ñ In the days to come
I travelled too far ñ To reach for the golden shrine, the evening star ñ But no matter where you are ñ You long for mama's food and daddy's car ñ Home is how the word is spelt ñ And belonging is the feeling felt ñ No matter where you go you'll always be a part ñ A thousand miles and I'm home ñ Take me back rolling ñ I have friends to see ñ Maybe I'm old ñ Life here is gold ñ Take me back safe ñ I have friends to see ñ Maybe I'm old ñ Life here is gold
Give up everything and incinerate your soul ñ No challenge if you never wanna go ñ Replaying messages, admission was your choice ñ Be selfless, shameless, bullied by a voice ñ  ñ There's no mercy on the mind ñ Pain for pleasure, you're alive ñ Alive ñ Alive ñ  ñ Twisting in the nature of a beast ñ You volunteered, so crazy for the heat ñ The heat ñ  ñ There's no mercy on the mind ñ Pain for pleasure, you're alive ñ Alive ñ Alive ñ Alive ñ Alive

Everyday i search for something soulful ñ I hope your doing the same cause ñ You know its true, its how i play ñ I never run, i never hide ñ Never laid down, lost my pride ñ That's what i said when she walked away ñ Walk away you walk away ñ That's how you solve all of your problems ñ You can fuck with me but not today ñ Cause i would rather try and solve them ñ Walk away ñ No more sorrow, not tomorrow ñ Only happiness today ñ You can hear when we play
It's a race against time ñ And there's nowhere to hide ñ So they look for the sign ñ In the sky ñ No sanctuary ñ But it's all a mistake ñ It's already too late ñ The key to our fate ñ Is inside ñ Yes, it's hidden away ñ From the light of the day ñ In the minds of ñ The masters of men ñ The damage is done ñ So the suffering goes on ñ With the aid of ñ The people's consent
One day you will awake ñ Life wasted, sold too cheap ñ Some way you'll find out ñ Solution and salvation ñ Have no regrets, End your days ñ Time to blast an exit!
I just like to lie around ñ Though he looks at an intimate group ñ My nose broke ñ And I helped you ñ It looks like I don't know ñ And if I know ñ Baby gotta go ñ It's true ñ That's more than I have assumed ñ It's just me and I'm not you ñ I shook it off too ñ I can do ñ When I see you ñ When I see you ñ When I see you ñ When I see you ñ I hope my eyes I am ñ I hope my eyes I am ñ I hope my eyes I am ñ I hope my eyes I am
You! ñ Alright, Alright ñ I've been, i've been yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah ñ Oh no oh no ñ 10 after 8, im running late ñ I jumped in my ride headed down the west side ñ I pick up the phone, is my shorty home ñ See i saw you in the club last night and you were looking rather fine ñ As fine as wine,you blew my mind ñ See i was hoping that we'd get together tonight
Hello ñ Indifference ñ Words that needs and wants to justify ñ My Eyes ñ Red is in my eyes ñ Same old soul of my lies ñ And lies ñ I won't stand like that again
You're precious ñ So selfless ñ You begin... ñ A hammering sound ñ What you wanna.. ñ Say what you wanna ñ What you wanna.. ñ Say what you wanna ñ You're selfish ñ Oh, you're selfish ñ If you will hear me... ñ My request is that you're not so cold ñ But you wanna ñ Say what you wanna ñ But you wanna ñ Say what you wanna ñ But you wanna ñ Say what you wanna ñ But you wanna ñ Say what you wanna hear

While you make pretty speeches ñ I'm being cut to shreds ñ You feed me to the lions ñ A delicate balance ñ And this just feels like spinning plates ñ I'm living in cloud cuckoo land ñ And this just feels like spinning plates ñ I'm living in cloud cuckoo land ñ And this just feels like spinning plates ñ Our bodies floating down the muddy river
I saw your eyes ñ The colour for the sinners shoes ñ I saw the sinner grinning softly at the bruse ñ Come alive ñ Blow my mind ñ Make her mine, no more lies ñ Come alive ñ Blow my mind ñ Make her mine, no more lies ñ I saw your smile ñ The mile of gilssening marron ñ I hear you laughing, as the puppet plays the tune ñ Come alive ñ Blow my mind ñ Make her mine, no more lies ñ Come alive ñ Blow my mind ñ Make her mine, no more lies ñ Pay the man hunny ñ Pay the man ñ Let love fall ñ Pay the man hunny ñ Pay the man ñ Let love fall

I wear my heart on my sleeve ñ It's the start of my get-up each day ñ That's where it stays ñ Cause I know the key to the world is through feelings ñ It's not through the eyes ñ Deceived by the skies ñ Leave me and I will reappear ñ Inside of your heart ñ I think real big, cause I cannot think small ñ If I want to live ñ In the world big and tall ñ Where would we be if we didn't believe ñ This was our one real chance ñ At a life loving dance ñ Leave me and I will reappear ñ Inside of your heart

Sing a song confessional ñ For the heart, mind and spirit ñ For the medical professional ñ Who isn't here to hear it ñ Who is not here to hear it ñ I was at the funeral ñ Eighth or ninth in the procession ñ Now it ain't all that unusual ñ To lose a month or two to depression ñ In desperate need of some medical attention ñ In desperate need of some medical attention ñ In desperate need of some medical attention

Tomorrow's dawn will never come ñ The sky turns black and is captured by eternal night ñ The stars will fade and the sun will descend ñ All life will vanish ñ When the storm hits the shore ñ The world known today - is lost - forever ñ An ocean in despair ñ As clouds turn into deepest grey ñ The horizon comes closer and hearts beat faster ñ The last breath taken becomes one with the storm

In the deepest solitude there is a road

I hate it! ñ My lover calls my teeth an invitation to my soul ñ But he does not understand the depth of my black hole ñ Fed by brothers basking in the season of the sick ñ My love is like a deadly poison lying on my lips ñ I feel the darkness of the doorway into my mothers room ñ Every time they beat my body underneath the moon ñ I hate heaven! I hate it! I hate it! ñ I hate heaven! I hate it! I hate it!
Caress inside my bones ñ Caress inside my bones ñ A house inside a home ñ A bird 90 times alone ñ A bird 90 times alone ñ I am always alone ñ I am always alone ñ A bird 90 times alone ñ A bird 90 times alone ñ I am always alone ñ I am always alone ñ A house inside a home ñ I am always alone
I wear the belt of hate ñ I wear the robe of sin ñ I wear the armour of demons ñ I wear the mark of Satan ñ I am the warlord ñ I am the knife ñ I am the thunderstorms ñ I am the vulture ñ I drink from lakes of sorrow ñ I drink from lakes of hell ñ I drink from lakes of evil ñ I drink from lakes of torment
I step into my spaceship ñ I'm on my way home ñ I hope that I will make it ñ But there's no way of knowing ñ The world is far behind me ñ I look into the sun ñ I know it's all because of you ñ Help me find the way to get home ñ And now my eyes have opened ñ I watch the stars glow ñ The sky is like an ocean ñ I'm floating alone ñ I know that I will make it ñ I look into your eyes ñ I know it's all because of you ñ Help me find the way to get you home
She walked out with empty arms ñ Machine gun in her hand ñ She is good and she is bad ñ No one understands ñ She walked in silence ñ Never spoke a word ñ She's got a rich daddy ñ She's her daddy's girl ñ  ñ She loves naked sin ñ He loves evil stares ñ She has lost control ñ They are growing old ñ  ñ She will hide in silence ñ Then her day will come ñ She was virgin vixen ñ She is on the run ñ She is on the run ñ She is on the run
Will i forever remain ñ Walking on these shores of your love? ñ The shores of your love ñ You are the river, the way ñ The daughter of the mountains of gold ñ The mountains of gold ñ And i become ashes from ashes ñ And dust from dust ñ If i keep on passing these chances ñ In fear and mistrust ñ The river ñ Will i thus never attain ñ A calling for the source of your love? ñ The source of your love ñ You are the giver, the flow ñ The ancient reflection of my soul ñ Reflection of my soul
Yes, I think a poem is a spell of kinds ñ That keeps things living in a written line, ñ Whatever's lost or leaving--lock of rhyme-- ñ And so I write and write and write your name.
Please don't drink so much ñ Drinking is bad for your heart & ñ Your organs they all fell down ñ Through the hole ñ That it's made in your gut ñ Please dont drink so much ñ I worry that you will die ñ Too fast to live ñ Is the stupidest saying ñ I've heard in my life ñ Please dont drink so much ñ Your mother would be sad ñ She's a nice lady ñ So show you deserve her ñ Or you'll only end up like ñ Your dad
All this light and someone asks you ñ Would you please sing songs with me? ñ I can sing this 1, 2, 3 times ñ If you show it to me ñ  ñ We get lost in neighbors' gardens ñ Trees so tall with angel wings ñ We must hurry, they don't worry ñ We just sing them a song ñ A song
This is not how it's supposed to be ñ The intimate crack in your smile ñ The force-fed up...crimson portraits ñ This is not it ñ And i want to see you fucking burn, baby ñ Isn't this this how you wanted it to be ñ It's all coming back to me now
Let there be you ñ Let there be me ñ Let there be oysters ñ Under the sea ñ Let there be wind ñ And occasional rain ñ Chili con carne ñ Sparkling champagne ñ Let there be birds ñ That sing in the trees ñ Someone to bless me ñ Whenever I sneeze ñ Let there be cuckoos ñ A lark and a dove ñ But first of all, please ñ Let there be love ñ Oh, love ñ Oh, let there be love ñ Let there be love
August 13th, 2015 ñ I tried to go into my part ñ I tried to go into my part ñ I tried to go into my part ñ I tried to go into my part ñ Fly me away, on a day like today ñ Spirits are high and love is free
Lyrics from Snippet ñ  ñ ...Took the Tesla, , shit get spooky word to Smooky MarGielaa ñ  ñ I ain't even wit that chit chat ñ 40 chains on my neck milli where my wrist at ñ Couple goons with the tool, when we pull up get back ñ Got a lame nigga callin' cause he want his bitch back
If I forgot what I knew, then I would be just like you ñ To live in such ignorance must be a blessing, if I were you, fuck, I'd be over the moon ñ If I forgot what I do, then I would still look for the truth ñ Whether it's painting or gardening, I would find happiness within any route ñ I hope you get money to spend and think that it's good 'til the end ñ Then realizations, they knock at your door when you don't got no choice but to go let 'em in ñ  ñ Like a bad dream ñ Like a bad dream
And in those days shall many seek death ñ And they'll not find it ñ And they'll not find it ñ And they'll desire to die ñ And death shall fly of them
Your love covers my sin ñ And washes over me ñ Your grace it draws me in ñ So I can live for You ñ Jesus You died for me ñ So I will live for You my God ñ I will lay down my life ñ For the cause of the Cross ñ And I won't try to ignore ñ That Your heart's cry is the lost ñ And I will go if You say go ñ And I will never give up ñ I will lay down my life ñ Because You laid down Your life ñ To set me free ñ Your love washes over ñ Over, over and over
Its' jumping off!!! ñ Revival of the corner stone I could never be alone ñ You promised me the comforter, my amour is the conqueror ñ The meek will surely inherit the earth, inspirational guardian Victoria's cure ñ Under the wing of the most high, unshakable faith with a champions stride ñ Tell that you want me to, tell me that you'll see it through ñ It's jumping off!!!
I'm, dreaming of a white, Christmas ñ Just like the ones I used to know ñ Where the treetops glisten ñ And children listen ñ To hear, sleigh bells in the snow ñ I'm, dreaming of a white, Christmas ñ With every Christmas card I write ñ May your days be merry, and bright ñ And may all your Christmases ñ Be white
In the jungle land ñ With the sea and the sand ñ Can I meet you there? ñ We'll be drinkin' bananas ñ From long tall glasses ñ In the open air ñ Ocean girl ñ Come 'round the world ñ From forgotten shores ñ There'll be music playin' ñ What no words could say ñ When you first get there ñ We'll be lost in a corner ñ That we find in each other ñ There' so much to share ñ Ocean girl ñ Come 'round the world ñ From forgotten shores
Above the freezing salted sea, a sailor waves hello
Shades of white ñ Float endlessly ñ Under shadows, over me ñ Through deep green moss ñ And singing air ñ By trees it flew ñ In halftone blue ñ Do you care? ñ Does it matter? ñ "Time is dear" ñ Did you utter? ñ "Time is money ñ Have to hurry" ñ If you find us ñ Please ñ Don't wake us ñ Endless paths through ñ Carpet grass ñ Painted fields and ñ Lakes of shimmer ñ Lost in time ñ Tumbling panorama
People come around the window ñ People come around the door ñ People come around and ask me ñ If I can say some more ñ  ñ Because I'm a whisper-man, yes I am ñ  ñ I can read somebody's back hand, and I can read your mind ñ What you need is body heat, ask for it any time ñ  ñ  ñ I can see up your staircase, and I can see down your hall ñ I can see almost anything, or anything at all ñ  ñ  ñ I can see behind your eyelid ñ I can see behind your head ñ I can only check you on the windshield ñ Write them on your bed
I knew a man with dirty hands ñ He blamed it all on me ñ He tried to sue my point of view ñ 'Cause he wants it all for free ñ Got no wigwam ñ To call his own ñ You can page him ñ But he's got no phone ñ I knew a man with dirty hands ñ Greets you with smiles full of teeth ñ Was no surprise he had stars in his eyes ñ And a hole in his soul underneath ñ Got no passport ñ To travel abroad ñ Cash conversion ñ Deception and fraud ñ I knew a man with dirty hands ñ He wants it all for free
Purple heaven ñ In a blaze of darkness ñ Creator of destiny ñ He was father to me ñ My obsecrations - please hear me lord ñ Obscure magical flame's burning ñ Effigy of ignorance is vanishing ñ The other gods, the other side... ñ Rapture... ñ Infestation of sacrificials to Inferno ñ Shadows of blood appear... ñ Worship in black ñ Scorned sanctities ñ Lost conscience ñ Dominion of conquerors ñ (repeat verse) ñ (repeat chorus) ñ Lead: LES ñ Lead: BART
When will you come clean with all the lies you're telling me ñ I'm no fool for you and I can see right through ñ This is really what you want cause this is really what I want ñ Looking can complicate my life but if you like ñ Let you your mind this is really what you want ñ Cause this is really what I want ñ When will you come clean with all the lies you are telling me ñ I am no fool for you and I can see right through ñ This is really what you want ñ Cause this is really what I want
Yesterday I was smiling ñ Everything seemed alright ñ But today sun's not shining ñ Seen you in a different light ñ I don't want you now ñ How can I love you now ñ Just keep away from me ñ 'cause you're killing me ñ Stop killing me ñ All the things I never asked for ñ All the things I thought were mine ñ Thought that I could see forever ñ Thought that things would work out fine ñ Repeat chorus
All I want is a mirror ñ So I can see this so ñ Called brighter day ñ I'm watching all the ñ World crawl back again ñ Watching how it blows ñ Itself away ñ That's all I want (x4) ñ All I want is destruction ñ Wanna see it crumble ñ Beneath my toes ñ Smell the way my sore ñ Eyes burn away ñ That's all I can have ñ Today ñ All you want is to be me ñ So you can screw me up ñ And don't give a damn ñ ('cos I'm a) crazy ñ Little daisy too vile to ñ Breathe ñ I'm everything you want ñ Today
Saw myself through another's eyes ñ What did I see to my surprise ñ Nuts and bolts rows of shops ñ Black Crow nights 'n' chimney tops ñ And one too many sad songs ñ Bible black and captain cat ñ Keeps the world inside his hat ñ With deep dry wells ñ And cockled shells ñ He holds his wife beneath his paws ñ 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4 and 3, 2 many 1 her
Right this time ñ Bet she want it, get it right this time ñ Bet she want it, get it right this time ñ She want it, get it right this time ñ  ñ All I do is all this is ñ I eat your food and fuck your bitch ñ I'm off that smoke, but keep that lit ñ I love that smell when I get it up
The sun rose first on the dead and on the sleeping ñ On the ruins of Victorian ironworks ñ On the terraced roofs of the miners ñ On the weekday pubs, and the Sunday chapels ñ And on the grimy, frowny hills ñ Every little boy's ambition in my valley was to become a miner ñ There was the arrogant strut of the lords of the coal face ñ One could stand on street corners and look at the posh people pass with hostile eyes ñ Insulting were these cold looks, because they were the kings of the underworld
Oh yes ñ My friend ñ I'm here ñ I'm here ñ I'm here ñ  ñ Didn't I say I would be? ñ Didn't I say I would be here? ñ And now there's so little chance of escape ñ And now there's so little chance of escape, of escape ñ  ñ Face me ñ Face me ñ Face me ñ  ñ I'm getting old ñ Face me ñ It's growing cold ñ Face me ñ  ñ Face me ñ Face me ñ Face me ñ Face me
Why can't it stay like this forever? ñ Why does it always have to change? ñ  ñ Every time you think you've paid the price ñ Seems you've always got to pay it twice ñ Every time you think you're near the end ñ You turn around and find another ticket ñ  ñ Oh my love, time is running out ñ Oh my love, time is running out ñ  ñ Why must we wait until tomorrow ñ When we already know the score?
If we want a future, then we must do what's right ñ If you wanna live  after 9 to 5 ñ Are you ready, are you willing, are you sure? ñ Are you steady as you stamp your feet upon the floor?
My darling ñ To show me that your mine girl ñ Just give me some kind of si-i-ign ñ Sign ñ My darling ñ To show me that your mine girl, alright ñ Just give me some kind of si-i-ign ñ Sign
I'm outside ñ Your window well ñ Incomplete ñ Alone ñ I believed ñ When you took my hand ñ Now your eyes are stone ñ It's like the end of time ñ Has swallowed me ñ I'm deep below the hours ñ I can't breathe ñ I'm deceit ñ And you're so clean ñ Purest angel glow ñ Don't you wake ñ I won't be long ñ It's just that i can't see ñ It's like the end of time ñ Has swallowed me ñ So deep below the hours ñ I can't breathe
Some of these days ñ You'll miss me honey ñ Some of these days ñ You'll feel so lonely ñ You'll miss my hugging ñ You'll miss my kissing ñ You'll miss me honey
I love the looks of you, the lure of you ñ I'd love to make a tour of you ñ The eyes, the arms, the mouth of you ñ The east, west, north, and the south of you ñ I'd love to gain complete control of you ñ And handle even the heart and soul of you ñ Love at least a small percent of me, do ñ For I love all of you
Swore you'd never take him back ñ Then the nymphomaniac ñ In you changed her mind ñ Are you fucking blind ñ You let the scum of the Earth ñ Drag you down ñ INTO THE SHITWORLD ñ Bid the world an adios ñ Your vital signs are comatose ñ Yet inside you scrape ñ And claw to escape ñ You let the scum of the Earth ñ Drag you down ñ INTO THE SHITWORLD

Arise thy king ñ O ruler of Rhine ñ Devastation lust for war ñ A perilous quest to conquer the West ñ I long for the days of the innocence ñ We've pushed them away ñ Barbaric be thy name ñ We've pushed them away ñ Tattoo your face for war ñ The scourge of God ñ Anything goes as I raise my sword ñ Chastise ñ My brother's demise ñ An endless conquest for more ñ An unsettled score ñ Why haven't we learned from our mistakes ñ Why put on the crown of thorns ñ Why waste your time ñ It's all been done before

I don't want to be hurt anymore ñ By a part-time love affair ñ And I don't want to cry like before ñ Why pretend, again, you care ñ Please don't coax me back into your arms ñ I've been fooled many times by your charms ñ I know if I kissed you, I might not resist you ñ I don't want to be hurt anymore ñ Please don't coax me back into your arms ñ I've been fooled many times by your charms ñ I know if I kissed you, I might not resist you ñ I don't want to be hurt anymore

Your legs walked your heart high ñ Your whole body is sprawling out ñ Major view wide
Take this gold body, annoint his heirs ñ Take a dollar for the crossing ñ From coins in his name ñ Souls slight of coin, slight of name ñ Then I'll meet you at the back gate ñ And greet you just the same ñ Tarry to my side and we'll walk over ñ To where the frosts of the dead king ñ Weigh heavy on the vine ñ Long it's been said that the worth of a man ñ Be his woman and his lands how he tends

In the summer sun of 1962 ñ The prettiest eyes were closing ñ From every picture that I ever knew ñ It never looked like you were posing ñ Norma, smile for the camera ñ I wasn't around to ever understand ñ Just how fast this world was turning ñ Was that you crying in the California sand? ñ The fuse was lit and time was burning ñ Norma, smile for the camera ñ So many years have gone by ñ And your commodity sales are doing fine ñ Norma, smile for the camera
Rock of ages cleft for me let me hide myself in Thee ñ Let the water and the blood from Thy wounded side which fload ñ Thee of sin the double cure save from raft and make me pure ñ Let me hime myself in Thee ñ In my hand no prize I bring simply to Thy cross I cling ñ While I draw this pleading breath when my eyes shall close in death ñ Lord when I rise to world unknown and behold the on Thy throne ñ Rock of ages cleft for me let me hime myself in Thee ñ Let me hime myself in Thee
Into uncharted future stare ñ Into uncharted future stare ñ Dwell in the confines of mortality ñ Gripping the hand of despair ñ Children of dust blown by winds of distress ñ Into uncharted future stare ñ Into uncharted future stare ñ  ñ Deep in the darkness without form and void ñ The hovering spirit of God ñ Man given life soon only to die ñ Fallen by deception ñ  ñ (Scarred hand of healing waits stretched from the sky) ñ Scarred hand of healing waits stretched from the sky ñ  ñ Into uncharted future stare
What I choose to do ñ Is of no concern to you ñ And your friends ñ Where I lay my hat ñ May not be my home ñ But I will last on my own ñ  ñ Cause it's me and my life ñ It's my life (it's my life) ñ  ñ Oh, the world has sat ñ In the palm of my hand ñ Not that you'd see ñ And I'm tired and bored ñ Of waiting for you ñ And all those things you never do ñ  ñ Cause it's me and my life ñ It's my life, it's my life

Everybody come on it's this great guy, in the middle of a field in the winter time, flowers are growing and everything is snowing now ñ You've gotta head up in you're feeling down, you've gotta turn back if you're upside down because you're always gonna get up in the morning and you're always gonna go to sleep in the evening
8 glasses, ñ 8 ounces, ñ 8 days a week
You duck, count, and run ñ I say 'Eeny-Meeny' ñ You took my mind and bent it freely ñ I don't know how you manage all alone ñ I think you put me through a change ñ I think you put me through a lovin' change ñ You are the pilot on my plane ñ You are the whistle on my new electric train ñ You are my magician's magic cane ñ I went to the barnyard to scratch a balloon ñ You know I'm all for love, I'm all forgiven ñ Someday I hope to give you my name

Lord hear the voice of Your people cry out ñ Oh oh oh 0h ñ We rejoice and sing ñ Rejoice and cry out ñ We rejoice and sing ñ Rejoice and say it loud ñ To our God to our God ñ Holy ñ Holy holy holy ñ Forever and ever ñ We will sing holy ñ We sing holy
Want you here with me next to me ñ In my bed ñ That's all I want from you ñ I don't want you to fuck ñ With my head ñ Let me lay with you ñ Play with you ñ Do what I say ñ Want you now but I sure as hell ñ Don't need you to stay ñ Down (below) ñ Friday night I let you know ñ Lay me down (below) ñ Saturday I take you home ñ Lay me down (below) ñ Sunday I want you to go ñ (Lay me down now)
And you let the beat slow down
"like anywhere else there are no ñ Coincidences, probability makes for ñ Accomplices and change creates meaning." ñ When we move, it's a movement

Succubi ñ In darkest night ñ In cold moonlight ñ While I'm asleep ñ They visit ñ Me ñ Hypnotized by dreams of sin ñ Darkness like fingers ñ Carress my ñ Skin ñ Their kisses ñ Drain away my life ñ My blood leaps out ñ Into ñ The night ñ Of usual need for this ecstasy ñ They give me pleasure ñ And ñ Take my seed ñ Hypnotized by dreams of sin ñ Darkness like ñ Fingers ñ Carress my skin ñ Succubi
There's a story the gypsies know is true ñ That when your love wears golden earrings ñ She belongs to you ñ An old love story that's known to very few ñ But if you wear those golden earrings ñ Love will come to you ñ By the burning fire, they will glow with ev'ry coal ñ You will hear desire whisper low inside your soul ñ So be my gypsy ñ Make love your guiding light ñ And let that pair of golden earrings ñ Cast their spell tonight
The longer I know her the more I can tell my darling's not happy with me ñ The longer I know that I know her too well the less love in her eyes I see ñ Cause she don't hold and kiss me like she did one time ñ I think my sweet baby's got leavin' on her mind ñ ( harmonica ) ñ The stronger I hold her the farther apart my darling is growing from me ñ The danger of my darling breaking my heart it's fast movin' in on me ñ Cause she don't hold and kiss me... ñ She don't hold and kiss me.. ñ She don't hold and kiss me..
She like the boys with the black hearts ñ She got an eye ta match ñ Tattoo on her neck says ñ "Burn bright and fast!" ñ She's a star, man ñ Just ask her ñ Light you up and take you down in flames ñ Tell the truth, I'm still laughing ñ But maybe she's your thing ñ She comes late if she comes at all ñ Don't you know her name? ñ Picture on the bathroom wall ñ Jones' hall of fame!
Transformation ñ Unable to sleep ñ Burning tears ñ The pain goes too deep ñ Every night ñ A pulsating stream ñ Tested motions ñ Electric beam ñ Give me love ñ Give me pain ñ Recreation ñ Endless solitude ñ Transformation ñ Emotion interlude ñ Shiny wires ñ Implanted veins ñ I desire ñ Memory remains ñ Wrong conclusions ñ I go insane ñ Controlled illusions ñ Remain the same
This ain't my first rodeo ñ Ten thousand (times) ñ Ten thousand (times) ñ They're walking ñ Running ñ They're marching ñ They're pushing ñ They're shoving ñ They're pressing (pressing on) ñ They go, press on ñ But reaching ñ Every step by step, to the grave ñ Pressing on ñ Every step by step, to the grave ñ Pressing on and on ñ Every step by step, to the grave ñ Step by step, to the grave ñ Pressing on ñ You have a song; unsung ñ I sing my song; falling on deaf ears ñ Unsung ñ Unsung ñ Unsung ñ Unsung ñ Unsung ñ Unsung
You've got me on the road ñ Runnin' to and fro ñ Lookin' high and low ñ I don't know if I'm coming or going ñ Since I fell for you ñ I run up across the town ñ Chasing up and down ñ Having you around ñ I don't know if I'm coming or going ñ Since I fell for you
Yeah yeah, woah woah ñ Yeah yeah, woah! ñ (Chorus] ñ Hey, uh, I am from uh outer space (Yeah) ñ I got a bitch from Kuwait (Yeah) ñ ....
Even while I've got my word it goes on and on ñ On and on, it goes on and on ñ Seen my fortune and I lift my words and they are everything ñ Oh oh, they are everything ñ Sailing boats and open roads can seem to pass you by ñ But sailing boats and open roads can pass you in disguise ñ Seen my days and oh I swear they go on and on ñ Oh oh, they go on and on ñ Have luck and it seems to work and it says everything ñ Oh oh, it goes on and on
Yeah! ñ Christianity, i feel ?... me ñ Take your pieces ?...

When you hold my own breath ñ I will take ñ 'Cause when we're all alone ñ The earth will quake ñ When your heart won't grow on you ñ Have faith ñ 'Cause when you hold my own you'd feel my weight ñ I can't wait (wait) ñ I can't, I can't wait
For the absolute, natural ñ for the cold, obvious ñ crystal clear ñ glass cold ñ transparent, legible ñ like ice, dew or new snow ñ stripped and bare ñ high standing and ready ñ it is high time for us ñ higher time for us ñ man as being ñ has never been higher
Stepping into tomorrow ñ Got funk beat on the ground ñ Stepping into tomorrow ñ My destiny is bound
We finally saw the night is there for the taking ñ The light did shine in your eye and my heart is breaking ñ Dont push me away ñ I'm here to stay ñ And the sand between our toes ñ They're the reasons why we should stay together ñ And we'll stare at the night ñ Don't push me away ñ I'm here to stay ñ Don't push me away ñ I'm here to stay
Take me, take me to the top of the world ñ Please me, got to pick me up, I'm miserable ñ Feeling, like nothing ever felt before ñ Dealing, it's got me coming back for more ñ Can't stop, you can't stop the rush ñ Spreading out and taking all control ñ One taste and you'll need it ñ Once in, you never leave it ñ So don't try to stop the rush ñ Slow kill, I know ill never be the same ñ Evil, the torture, gonna drive me insane ñ Feeding, the ritual begins again ñ Breathing, overload of adrenaline
Heaven ñ Is such a nice place ñ You never loved me ñ You never cared ñ Wrap me in chains ñ For a million years ñ And I won't care ñ Yes it could be magic ñ Just for you to be with me ñ In heaven, my heaven ñ Oh, angel, my little angel ñ You did me harm ñ You told me lies ñ And took away my every dream ñ Oh, heaven ñ Is such a nice place ñ You never loved me ñ You never cared
The moon, the sign of hope ñ It appeared when we left the pain of the ice-desert behind ñ We faced up to the curse and endured misery ñ Condemned we are ñ We brought hope, but also lies, and treachery
Love bends the earth, it straightens the road ñ It dives for pearls, it lightens the load ñ Love bends the rules, making good out of bad ñ Opens your eyes, helping you understand ñ Love bends are worst, drive you out of your mind ñ Stop you from eating, losing track of all time ñ Love bends are cursed, strike you down from behind ñ Give you night vision, makes you soft, make you kind ñ Love bends are bad, they quicken the blood ñ They make you better, they make you feel good
Comb down your long dark hair ñ Comb the tangles that you wear ñ Find me ñ Quickly ñ Pull the knots ñ From your long dark hair
I dust my pictures every day ñ I see them now in different way ñ I steal your books and you steal mine ñ I steal your books and you steal mine ñ I dust my pictures every day ñ I see them now in different way ñ I steal your books and you steal mine ñ I steal your books and you steal mine ñ We have the pleasure that we find ñ We have the pleasure that we find ñ I don't want to eat all I see ñ I don't believe all that I read ñ Life is too short ñ Still we make a show ñ We are unhealthy and fragile ñ We are unhealthy and fragile
Walls are closing in around you ñ My twins of evil ñ Shake you by the collarbone ñ Then shake your ribcage ñ Broken bodies in a death rock dancehill ñ Please be my partner ñ Eyeballs pop excelerated blood beat ñ Veins are shaking ñ And all the hell breaks loose! ñ Who but me could write the book of cruel ñ I send my murdergram to all the monsterkids ñ It comes right back to me ñ Signed in their parents blood ñ And all the hell breaks loose! ñ Yeah my heart is breaking loose! ñ ...my whole world is breaking loose!
It's a whole other story ñ Is there time, can I tell? ñ Just another adventure ñ Will the end be the same ñ 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, none ñ Thought it all came together but it all came undone ñ 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5 ñ What with all that I've done ñ I'm just glad I'm alive ñ Maybe there's no answer ñ And it pains me to think ñ Maybe it doesn't matter ñ In the world's grander scheme
Black is the colour of my true love's hair ñ Her lips are like a rose so fair ñ She's got the sweetest face and the gentlest hands ñ I love the ground whereon she stands ñ I love my love and well she knows ñ I love the ground whereon she goes ñ And how I whish the day would come ñ When she and I can be as one ñ I go to the Clyde and mourn and weep ñ Satisfied I never will sleep ñ I 'll write her a letter, just a few short lines ñ And suffer death ten thousand times
In dreams we'll always be together ñ Beneath the moonlit sky ñ We mustn't say goodbye ñ Each night I'll push aside the mountains ñ I'll drain the oceans dry ñ We mustn't say goodbye ñ I promise you that when the postman rings ñ My heart will be inside ñ The envelope he brings ñ Oh, don't you know the memories we gathered ñ Can never, never die ñ We mustn't say goodbye

Scabs of the past peeling slowly from a dark and distant memory ñ Emptiness ñ Whispering menace glinting beneath the skin ñ Consumption in the vast eternal maw ñ Decaying teeth flickering over the tongue of the faceless ñ Debasement of eternal torment ñ Dark is the light ñ Dark is the light ñ And everything is black
Total devastation ñ Fire in my body ñ Cells are checking out ñ From melting brain motel ñ Spiral formation ñ Rumbles in my ears ñ Like a roller coaster ñ But always going down
It's like a wide triangle ñ Hum, it's a triangle ñ One thing, like a bell ñ A crystal ball ñ Growing in the darkness ñ One thing, like a chiming sound
Take me home, tend to me ñ Baby lay me down easy ñ For I have grown weary on my own ñ  ñ All alone ñ I wither and I bruise ñ I run my mouth like a fool ñ  ñ I'll be so quiet for you ñ Look like a child for you ñ Be like a shadow of a shadow ñ Of a shadow for you ñ  ñ Take me home, tend to me ñ Baby lay me down easy ñ For I have grown weary on my own ñ  ñ All alone ñ I wonder aimless ñ I work the corner of an endless grid ñ  ñ I'll be so still for you ñ Like a dead dog ñ Lay there till my eyes pop ñ All for you

No one in this country of ours wants war ñ If war should come, we shall not call a halt until the oppressor is beaten ñ Democracy will triumph ñ Pay no attention to rumours ñ All have a vital part to play ñ You must be ready to obscure all lights in your house ñ And to extinguish all lights inside ñ Nobody in this country of ours wants war ñ But if war should come, don't be alarmed ñ Keep a good heart ñ Whatever happens, Britain is a nation prepared ñ I have to tell you now, this country is at war
I mean, tonight is history because ñ I got one of - I got a fuckin legend standing behind me ñ When I turned around, I saw this nigga ñ I was like stop the music, and let the motherfuckers know ñ That DMX is in this building!
After you leave me, after you're gone ñ I'll sit here crying so blue and alone ñ And when the door closes ñ I'll close my heart too ñ After you leave me what will I do ñ  ñ After you've taken the beat of my heart ñ After you've torn my world all apart ñ My life will be worthless here without you ñ After you leave me what will I do ñ  ñ  ñ After you've taken the beat of my heart ñ After you've torn my world all apart ñ My life will be worthless here without you ñ After you leave me what will I do
This is your last chance, now it has begun ñ Collapsing, faster, behind these closed doors ñ Altered stories told ñ A new promise, loss ñ Tarnished, won't be told ñ Now you all await ñ The world is easy to float ñ It is a chain to the throat ñ This is your last chance, now it has begun ñ This is your last chance, now it is done

(Missing Lyrics)
Heavy street fighting ñ Been going on for days ñ Makeshift graves outside city limits ñ Filled with bodies of slaughtered people ñ Men, women, little children all dead ñ The massacre - why? ñ The massacre - why? ñ Eight month foetus ñ Sticking on a bayonet ñ Motherg's just a piece of dead meat ñ Eight month foetus ñ Sticking on a bayonet ñ Motherg's just a piece of dead meat ñ You murdered me with rope ñ You murdered me with guns too ñ You massacred whole families ñ And laughed throughout their pain ñ Repeat verses 1 & 3
Severing uterus as the ovaries are rent ñ Your leaking gap is utterly split ñ Throbbing in excruciation your crotch is mangled ñ I gleefully carve up the bladder and slice up the cervix with mirth ñ The fundus is now a stump as I dismantle the afterbirth ñ The fetus is carved ñ Embryonic execration ñ Umbilical excoriation
Cloud, haze, fog ñ Makes it harder to remember where we are ñ Time, change, void ñ It`s harder to remember where we are ñ Will you be my wild dream? ñ Hiding in a distant memory ñ Will I wake up and know that you're not real ñ And eventually forget the way I feel
Bell on door clanks, come on in ñ Floyd observes my hairy chin ñ Sit down chair, don't be afraid ñ Steamed hot towel on my face ñ  ñ I was shaved ñ I was shaved ñ I was shaved ñ  ñ Barney ties me to the chair ñ I can't see I'm really scared ñ Floyd breathes hard, I hear a zip ñ Pee-pee pressed against my lips ñ  ñ I was shamed ñ I was shamed ñ I was shamed ñ  ñ I sense others in the room ñ Opie, Aunt Bee, I presume ñ They take turns and cut me up ñ I die smothered in Aunt Bee's muff ñ  ñ I was shamed ñ I was shamed ñ I was shamed
(Verse) ñ It's so hazy ñ What you're breathing ñ Where you going? ñ You're still dreaming ñ If they fall down ñ What will you say? ñ But you don't care ñ Feels are your day
Who needs forever? ñ Love me today, let's forget tomorrow ñ It's too far away, so hold me, don't waste this moment ñ Let's live this moment like it's the last ñ Time goes so fast ñ Love shouldn't linger, love shouldn't wait ñ When fates allow a choice of now or never ñ Who needs forever? ñ Love shouldn't linger, love shouldn't wait ñ When fates allow a choice of now or never ñ Who needs forever? ñ Forever, forever
Going way beyond the line ñ Hoping, hoping you're alright ñ And I'm feeling ñ Feeling old and tired ñ I'm feeling, feeling old life ñ  ñ But I won't lie ñ No, I won't lie ñ Will you, won't you? ñ Will you, won't you? ñ  ñ Sending all these different signs ñ But yours aren't quite the same as mine ñ But I'm feeling, feeling old and tired ñ I'm feeling, feeling old life ñ  ñ  ñ Will you, won't you?
Twisting tongues expand his lungs ñ Pollute the air that we breathe ñ Playing mind games ñ Try and make me fail in what I believe ñ Turn your back, knife attack ñ He slits your throat once again ñ You're too quick to point the finger ñ Open your eyes and realise the truth ñ You have been living off my name for far too long ñ You'll never be the man I am ñ Live in my shadows ñ Beg for my mercy ñ Don't tell me that I'm wrong ñ Nothing but obey
Drawn by the power of the ultraviolet sun ñ Spinning eye of the Lord, it looks upon ñ Magnetic cobs spread forth and spin a web ñ I can see a thousand worlds right here in my bed ñ Oh yeah ñ Looking all around, the world's a dream ñ Traveling to places that I have never seen ñ High up here is where I'm really free ñ Listen people, you've got to free the weed ñ Oh yeah ñ Yeah, you knew the deal ñ You knew I would make you feel ñ But look around you, what you got ñ No hope, no future, no fuckin' job ñ Yeah
I was just fucked up, I was just down, down bad
Through boughs and leaves and stone on ground ñ I feel a presence of evil, a silent sound ñ An evil place once lovely and fair ñ Itis gardens are grey, sad voices of despair ñ A village old, pillaged and raped ñ All itis houses are rotten or burnt ñ Here are signs of battles of old ñ Raided for the virgins and their gold ñ From where cometh this evil air? ñ The pressing warning of danger
(Instrumental) ñ I felt the best things in the world ñ There's nothing you can say about that to me ñ That I don't already kno-o-ow ñ When I give up a million times ñ And I could use the company ñ I know you'll always be aro-o-ound ñ And you know one thing's that ñ When we're togethe-e-er ñ You're there for me ñ And I've got you wo-o-oah ñ You don't care if I sing off-key ñ (Ay) ñ And I'll never let you down ñ I hope you do the same for me ñ Chelsea
Be careful that you don't ñ Use up your ninth one ñ We all were careless once ñ We all were careless once ñ It can't be too much fun ñ Just going 'round once ñ It all can slip away ñ One banana peel away ñ You left this big ole void ñ Sure miss your sweet voice ñ Gone into the void ñ We all were careless once ñ We all were careless once ñ We all were careless once ñ We all were careless once ñ We all were careless once
Cashing in exploit the misfortune ñ Of some poor bastard that eats shit unwillingly ñ Millions descend on morbid momentos ñ Outpouring of grief means outpouring of cash ñ Parade of pestilence ñ Parade of pestilence ñ Making profits from unfocused affection ñ Feeding parasites with wanton delight ñ Snapping grabbing all haunting collectables ñ Top prices paid for the memories of the dead ñ Rest forever fear feeds fear ñ Rest forever fear feeds fear ñ Rest forever fear feeds fear ñ Rest forever fear feeds fear
You want to go to school ñ You want a good job ñ You want to get married ñ You want to own a car ñ  ñ You're boring, you're gay, you're old ñ You have goals ñ You're boring, you're gay, you're old ñ You have goals ñ You want to own a house ñ You want to have kids ñ If these are your goals ñ Then you're fucking stupid
I know I prefer to hurt ñ It seems to comfort me and burn ñ I never asked for it - question ñ I never wanted it to end ñ I know that I die gracefully in vain ñ I know inside deteriorates in pain ñ You're such a part of me ñ I can't believe it's real ñ I crawl in my black box to hide ñ I welcome misery with pride ñ Takes turns in whipping me, I bleed ñ Enjoy the fantasy and greed ñ Oh my goth! ñ Subject me to your world ñ Oh my goth! ñ Take pleasure in my hurt
Happy Birthday to you ñ Happy Birthday to you ñ Happy Birthday dear Mike ñ Happy Birthday to you
... Fragmented souls ñ Unbecoming to creatures ñ Once known as a ñ Human form of mortality ñ Ancestors of an aerial aeon ñ Servants in nocturnal hours ñ Cursed on their quest for redemption
Wind chimes flicker ñ Brittle corners slide away ñ Smile back at the day ñ Shadows flying ñ Like the mist before the sun ñ See the sadness run ñ Silk-spun web of pearls ñ Glistens in the grass in summer ñ North wind changes all the fields ñ To dazzling glass in winter ñ Come near to me ñ Hear this song I sing to you ñ Are you singing, too?
Laura is the face in the misty light ñ Footsteps that you hear down the hall ñ The laugh that floats on a summer night ñ That you can never quite recall ñ And you see Laura on the train that is passing thru ñ Those eyes, how familiar they seem ñ She gave your very first kiss to you ñ That was Laura but she's only a dream
Out under the winter sky ñ Out under the winter sky ñ Stars come trembling on my eye ñ Stars to tremble my eye ñ And I feel like someone's gonna die ñ I feel like someone's gonna die ñ I feel like someone's gonna die ñ Hand me wings for to fly ñ High is heaven in early morn ñ High is heaven in early morn ñ Men lie sleeping in beds that are warm ñ Sleep in beds that are warm ñ And I feel like someone's being born ñ I feel like someone's being born ñ I feel like someone's being born ñ Tells my soul not to moan

I know the pain ñ I know the panic ñ The emotional plane is hyperkinetic ñ When your father died and went to a better place ñ It existed inside your inner space ñ The dreams I've had ñ The open fields ñ The friendly kiss so natural ñ You've given me faith now I see everything as real ñ Then I wake up ñ Those Latin globes behind soft hands ñ Like satin robes and Iberian sands ñ One more missed chance as I talk to her ñ It's lost, why bother!?!
Lord, I love to call You holy ñ For holy is what You are to me ñ Lord, I love to call You holy ñ For holy is what You are ñ Yes, holy is what You are ñ Yes, holy is what You are to me ñ  ñ Lord, I love to call You Father ñ Father is what You are to me ñ Lord, I love to call You Father ñ Father is what You are ñ Father is what You are ñ A Father is what You are to me ñ  ñ Lord, I love to call You faithful ñ Faithful is what You are to me ñ Lord, I love to call You faithful ñ  ñ Faithful ñ  ñ Faithful (is what You are to me)

It's your face I'll see at the end of the day ñ If I die before I do I'll be a ghost for you ñ If you feel me in your bones. I have found a home ñ Permanent like a tattoo. I'll be a ghost for you ñ There is no wind or snow that can separate us cold ñ Even if I don't make it through. I'll be a ghost for you ñ Avalanche may fly and cover up my eyes
You're lonely and I'm lonely ñ So why can't we be lonely together? ñ The night is young and while it grows older ñ We can't forget crying on each other's shoulder ñ The sky's cloudy 'cause we're lonely ñ But soon we'll see a change in the weather ñ Two lonely hearts beating as one ñ Can be miserable and still have a lot of fun
Dying slowly inside ñ Shit aching all-time ñ Mama miss me when I vibe ñ I just wanna die tonight ñ Writing in this bus ñ Thinking about us ñ Acting like it's cool ñ But the World is just too cruel ñ  ñ You told me to move on ñ I don't wanna leave You alone ñ Just give me a sign ñ Get this pain out of my mind

As the winter let spring come ñ I shed my skin and come alive ñ A new retrospect, a sign ñ And words of torment that hunt the sick ñ Now this is my shelter ñ And this is my heart ñ You've lived on my weakness ñ You tore me apart ñ As the time that we have spent ñ So few of us have followed on ñ A place of refuge, a place called home ñ It's in this room where I heal my wounds ñ Now this is my shelter ñ And this is my heart ñ You've lived on my weakness ñ You tore me apart
When you look away ñ In the sea ñ You see the sea in the sky ñ While she swims ñ You want to go ñ To their feast ñ You cannot reach them ñ You don't fit in this twist ñ There 's no place for us there, darling ñ Though we 're here by the sea ñ Let me join my eyes to yours now, baby ñ And build our own dream
I hear their motor calling ñ I hear their white Christ ñ Say a prayer ñ Say a prayer over me ñ Goodbye California ñ I'm crawling on the floor tonight ñ Say a prayer over me ñ I know I won't be ready ñ And someone else is laughing now ñ Say a prayer over me ñ No matter what they're saying ñ I never hated anyone ñ Say a prayer over me
I've been mad for fucking years ñ Absolutely years, been over the edge for yonks ñ Been working me buns off for bands ñ I've always been mad, I know I've been mad ñ Like the most of us have ñ Very hard to explain why you're mad ñ Even if you're not mad
Hoo-oo ha-a ha-a hoo-oo ñ Precious moments ñ When will I see you again ñ When will we share precious moments ñ Will I have to wait forever ñ Will I have to suffer ñ And cry the whole night trough? ñ When will I see you again ñ When will our hearts beat together? ñ Are we in love or just friends? ñ Is this my beginning ñ Or is this the end? ñ When will I see you again? ñ Hoo-oo- a hoo-oo ñ Precious moments ñ Are we in love or just friends? ñ Is this my beginning ñ Or is this the end? ñ When will I see you again
Darling, I know that you still take care of me ñ It means the world to me ñ And my life sways back and forth like the light from above ñ It's true, now we we both can see opportunity ñ Or our chance ñ But, mother, you knew your love kept on hurting me ñ But you're my family, why would you? ñ But father and you, you tried to take care of me ñ But she came through for me, either side ñ She became my sun, my moon ñ She's my evergreen ñ She means the world to me ñ She means the world
Today I hurt my ankle, I passed out from the pain. ñ I thought that it was broken, turns out it's just a sprain. ñ I didn't get any crutches, no bandages, no bruise. ñ A slightly swollen lump, just isn't enough proof. ñ If you where to feel it you'd expect it to be blue, a mangled mess with a bone sticking out, you'd call an ambulance too. ñ But I'm smiling with my ice pack, this sort of goes to show, people can feel like they're on fire, and you'd never really know.
Before we go through this ñ Well there's something you should know ñ There's a monster in my clothes ñ There's a monster under all this tulle ñ You'll never get out ñ If you still want to do this ñ Well we should do it alone ñ So that no one can object to you throwing out your chance at happiness ñ Oh the worst thing that ever happened yet was the day we met, fact: ñ You couldn't even stand me then ñ So what's this dress for? ñ What's this mess you're getting in?
These are the JB's...
To get straight ñ You're not that real despite of all ñ Seasons changed ñ I'm sure it's all I can ever get ñ All in the middle, in the middle side ñ It's all in your heart ñ All in the middle is little thing ñ It's not in your life
Get The Fuck Up! ñ What? ñ Move!
Cynical, it's just your way ñ You play the doubting Thomas ñ Feel the scars and wipe the stains ñ So you fight, and retreat ñ And talk yourself out of believing ñ In any peace that you can't see ñ Blind words you call ñ Blind words will fall ñ You're logical, you can't find ñ Any reason to believe in love, you are blind ñ Crucify, and deny ñ Pass the blame and burn the mission ñ Till dust remains and wash your hands ñ Blind words you call ñ Blind words will fall ñ Blind words you call ñ Blind words will fall
Fast asleep she's been waiting to creep for a long time ñ Faint lit eyes slowly swallowing vibes from the waistline ñ Only dreams can deliver these things to my bedside ñ Airy shrugs says she's pulling the plugs to the outside ñ  ñ Lengthy days in a lovesick haze chemical fire ñ Lofty phase pulling minimum wage fans the desire ñ Lucid nights bring her perfumed sight to admire ñ All in all moments to recall and retire
Like prisoners in the perfect jail ñ The workers needn't be watched ñ Because they watch themselves ñ Not only those who give the orders ñ But those who command what orders to give ñ We are guard and guarded at once ñ Status, position, competition, reward ñ We are guard and guarded at once ñ Misdirection, deception, illusion, control ñ Teetering just on the edge, the edge of the abyss ñ The meaningless nothing, the grim infinite ñ We are guard + guarded at once

Yay, yay, yay ñ I'm a lonely boy in a lonely world ñ There's no place left for me ñ I've been everywhere in the world there is ñ I've sailed the seven seas ñ But when I return it's always the same ñ No one's waiting for me ñ I'm a lonely boy in a lonely world ñ So now I'll sail the seas once more ñ Now I'll sail the seas
They've got the wrong thing, no ñ They've got the wrong thing, no ñ I don't know ñ  ñ Until the end ñ I will be right here ñ Until the end ñ Until the end ñ Owwww ñ I will be right here ñ I will be right here ñ I will be alright, alright (x3)

When I'm out walking I strut my stuff yeah I'm so strung out ñ I'm high as a kite I just might stop to check you out ñ Let me go on like I blister in the sun ñ Let me go on big hands I know your the one ñ Body and beats I stain my sheets I don't even know why ñ My girlfriend she's at the end she is starting to cry ñ Let me go on like I blister in the sun ñ Let me go on big hands I know your the one...
On a windy day, let's go on flying ñ There may be no trees to rest on ñ There may be no clouds to ride ñ But we'll have our wings and the wind will be with us ñ That's enough for me ñ That's enough for me ñ On a windy day, we went on sighing ñ There were no sea to rest on ñ There were no hills to glide ñ We saw an empty bottle rolling down the street ñ And on a cupboard stand at corner of the street ñ Wrinkled souls piled up like grapefruit
(luke white sucking meat) ñ  ñ Fuck this stupid ass song were the 88
I look back and I'm amazed ñ That my thoughts were so clear and true; ñ That three words went through my mind endlessly ñ Repeating themselves like a broken record... ñ You're so cool ñ You're so cool ñ You're So cool
Anyone can join my love ñ It's just drippin off ñ When i walk down the street ñ And if you soak up this love ñ You won't feel half empty ñ Ba-ba-ba... ñ Anyone can drink my love ñ You soak it up as you ñ Slip down the stairs ñ Every job will make you broke ñ Every house is not a home ñ Ba-ba-ba...

Their ways are open ñ They spread as their wings ñ They want to be certain ñ Of a warm surrounding ñ  ñ When they fly ñ Through the night as beautiful ñ Nighttime birds ñ When they fly ñ Through the night as beautiful ñ Nighttime birds ñ  ñ The warm wind picks them up ñ  ñ When they fly ñ Through the night as beautiful ñ Nighttime birds ñ When they fly ñ Through the night as beautiful ñ Nighttime birds ñ  ñ  ñ When they fly ñ Through the night as beautiful ñ Nighttime birds ñ When they fly ñ Through the night as beautiful ñ Nighttime birds
I've taken this joy ride, too long today; ñ Those feelings are old songs, always ñ Disneyland of death play, businessmen sing in hallways ñ It's just another day here in this free love house I live ñ The loneliness time I fear, nothing but a love to give ñ Why must this life be so cruel? ñ The landlord made a pass at me ñ Scrub, scrub with steel wool, I'm still never clean ñ Sometimes she wishes it wasn't so strong ñ Hearts break like dishes, so easily, so long
C' mon baby cross your fingers as you walk home with me ñ I see your fear feedin the demons inside ñ You're callin' back 13 ñ Oooh I heard the pipers calling ñ Till 13 don't mean a thing to me ñ Ooohh I herad the pipers calling ñ And the rain fell over me ñ Now I'm falling flat on my face don't turn me over ñ Today I had a lie for breakfast ñ I had a goodbye from a monkey friend ñ Oooh I saw the pipers falling ñ And your face turn around again ñ 13 13 13 13 13 13 ñ 13 wings on my back
Quickening of reminiscence ñ Cradled in radiant Arkham ñ Death is what has been given ñ My emptiness runs ñ Destroy me it is my wish ñ To fill this grave in the air ñ This crooked skeleton tumults ñ In a horrible silence ñ Zoom in and down from in an unnatural way ñ Just like you I have no name
Oh, Suzy Q ñ Oh, Suzy Q ñ Oh, Suzy Q ñ Baby, I love you, Suzy Q ñ I love the way you walk ñ I love the way you talk ñ I love the way you walk ñ I love the way you talk, Suzy Q ñ You say that you'll be true ñ You say that you'll be true ñ You say that you'll be true ñ Baby, I love you, Suzy Q ñ Whoa, Suzy Q ñ Whoa, Suzy Q ñ Oh, Suzy Q ñ Baby, I love you, Suzy Q ñ Whoa, Suzy Q ñ Whoa, Suzy Q ñ Oh, Suzy Q ñ Baby, I love you, Suzy Q

Cray fish creep bridge and sky ñ And my life flash before my eyes ñ Trying to see ñ What I'd never seen otherwise ñ Cray fish creep bridge and sky ñ And my life flash before my eyes ñ Trying to see ñ What I'd never seen otherwise
...At night ñ The day ñ The low and living fog ñ In dark ñ The light ñ A soft and steady drug... ñ We fall ñ For days ñ Attract a looming glow ñ The sun ñ Could sink ñ If I would let it go...
For some reason i believe in burying myself in good feelings ñ Warm warm feelings ñ Sometimes there's nothing else alive ñ Your living your breathing your bitching even more ñ Your tunnel and all its darkness what is the act all for alive
Guga 'mzimba (body grow old) ñ Sala 'nhliziyo (but heart remain behind) ñ Missing ñ Burning tyres on the freeway ñ Noone in sight ñ Thre's a raging calm ñ Across the land tonight ñ Voice on the radio says ñ Another one's down tonight ñ It don't matter anymore ñ Which side he's on ñ Came to your place to see ñ If you're all right ñ And the shadows ñ Danced across the stairway ñ Flight after flight ñ And I was banging at your door ñ But you weren't there anymore ñ And the G-man stepped ñ Into the light and said ñ "This is war!" ñ Chorus
A man I know to keep alive ñ Dies for a living ñ To survive to keep alive ñ Dies for a living ñ Stands upon a stage each night ñ Matinees from two to five ñ To keep the show alive ñ Dies for a living ñ I've taken the position, do or die ñ Not to survive for ñ Nor to keep alive for ñ Not to die for a living
I want to kill everybody in the world ñ I want to kill everybody in the world ñ I want to kill everybody in the world ñ I want to kill everybody in the world ñ Oeee oeee oeee, I want to eat your heart ñ I want to kill everybody in the world ñ I want to kill everybody in the world ñ I want to kill everybody in the world ñ I want to kill everybody in the world

And I want to walk all over you like a floorboard ñ And I want to lie like a politician ñ And I want to do those things your friends do ñ And I want to be just like them
I'm trav'lin' light ñ Because my man has gone ñ But from now on ñ I'm trav'lin' light ñ He said, "Goodbye" ñ And took my heart away ñ So from today ñ I'm trav'lin' light ñ No one to see ñ I'm free as the breeze ñ No one but me ñ And my memories ñ Some lucky night ñ He may come back again ñ But until then ñ I'm trav'lin' light ñ No one to see ñ I'm free as the breeze ñ No one but me ñ And my memories ñ Some lucky night ñ He may, he may come back again ñ But until then ñ I'm trav'lin' light
My destination, I'll give it all I got ñ This realization is long overdue ñ I'm fascinated with the way you move ñ Your many colors could light up the room ñ You bring the light of love ñ Cause fate leads the way ñ When my eyes are closed I think of you ñ Cause fate leads the way ñ Can't see the future, don't know what she'll bring ñ I'll sit here waiting one day at a time ñ It's complicated, don't know what it means ñ I hope the stars will still be aligned
Don't want ñ Don't need ñ Don't care ñ Won't give ñ  ñ I don't want ñ I don't need ñ I don't care ñ And I won't give ñ I don't want ñ I don't need ñ I don't care ñ And I won't give ñ All I need is only solutions ñ All I need is only solutions ñ All I need is only solutions ñ All I need is only solutions (don't want, don't need, don't care, won't give) ñ All I need is only solutions (don't want, don't need, don't care, won't give) ñ All I need is only solutions ñ All I need is only solutions
Blue Boy, worried 'bout the world's eyes ñ Worried, every time the sun shines ñ Worried 'bout his haircut ñ Calm down, sweetheart, grow up ñ  ñ Blue Boy ñ Blue Boy ñ Blue Boy ñ Blue Boy ñ  ñ Blue Boy, older than the world knows ñ Honey, that's the way that life goes ñ No use acting so tough ñ Calm down, sweetheart, grow up ñ  ñ Blue Boy ñ Blue Boy ñ Blue Boy ñ Blue Boy
Gotta gal ñ An she's so fair ñ Those eyes the blackest hair ñ Behind those ñ I gotta gal ñ An she's so fine ñ All the boys stand in line ñ Keep your hands to yourself boy tonight
I love Your grace I love Your mercy ñ I love the way You help me when I call ñ I love your truth I love the power of your name ñ But you know I love your presence most of all ñ My soul takes refuge in the shadow of the lord ñ And close to you is where I want to be ñ You are my strength you are my God you are my king ñ And all I want is what you want for me
I don't know how you can tell me ñ That I don't understand ñ I've been on those shoes before ñ And I made my plan ñ I don't want to hear those lies ñ I don't want to hear those cries ñ I don't want to live that way again ñ I don't want to live that way again ñ I found my way out; ñ The Savior from my sin ñ He takes away all the misery and pain ñ So you won't have to live that way again..
Listen ñ Jump on a moonbeam and ride ñ Ride it, glide it, all the way ñ As the moon speaks ñ To the waves of the sea ñ And of an ocean relic ñ Of the times that used to be ñ Many years have past ñ Since your vision came to me ñ And I think of you only ñ As the moon speaks to the sea
Maybe I need you ñ Maybe I need you ñ Maybe I need you ñ Maybe I need you
Kick off ñ Need to know ñ Get up ñ Living in oblivion ñ Find the answers ñ Fell rushed ñ Politics in action ñ Against the law ñ Change now ñ Who's the best ñ Who's last ñ The birth of a nation ñ Kingdom lost ñ Who's the best ñ Who's last ñ Land of freedom ñ Find the answers ñ Freak now
Heigh ho! Who is there? ñ No one but me, my dear ñ Please come say, How do? ñ The things I'll give to you ñ By stroke as gentle as a feather ñ I'll catch a rainbow from the sky ñ And tie the ends together ñ Heigh ho! I am here ñ Am I not young and fair? ñ Please come say, How do? ñ The things I'll show to you ñ Would you have a wond'rous sight ñ The midday sun at midnight? ñ Fair maid, white and red ñ Comb you smooth and stroke your head ñ How a maid can milk a bull! ñ And every stroke a bucketful
She's not the best ñ Prettyish but like the rest ñ She does her best ñ To live up to the image ñ Of the magazines ñ Pouting to the point of no return ñ Mooing 'til the cows come home ñ Mooing 'til the cows come ñ Home Virginia ñ Home Virginia ñ Home... home
We are the light that guides you home ñ The light is always darkest before the dawn ñ This is the rising sun ñ It hangs from up above ñ Blinding the children from the darknesses they've come to love ñ This is the rising sun ñ Forget the things you loved ñ Find the reason and the will to rise above ñ This is who we are ñ Screaming out ñ This is the year of the rising sun ñ We are the light that guides you home
Too dark, too soon and no action ñ This started a chemical reaction ñ Fall asleep, falling deep, come ascension ñ This martyr is looking for attention ñ Summer break my fall ñ Summer break my fall ñ Hear me when I call ñ Summer break my fall ñ Hot sand, green grass and affection ñ Jump in, got to go, no direction ñ Get away, I can't stay, it's getting colder ñ Help me lift this weight off my shoulder ñ I hope the sun will save me ñ On my way down ñ Once here you cannot blame me
You have no heart left to break ñ Now your Soul has grown weary ñ The numbness you now feel ñ Growing stronger with the distance ñ Now you're alone ñ Your sacrifice goes unrecognized ñ You'll die inside ñ Inside you'll die ñ Everything that you ever knew as sacred ñ Has now left you blind ñ No silver lining ñ Humanity has made you a slave ñ You have no hope left to take ñ You sold your mind to the devil ñ All the self doubt you know feel ñ Believing every word you were told ñ Still alone ñ Your effort have all gone for not
Am I wrong to want you near? ñ A bit of heaven with you beside me ñ I see your face in the eyes of the sky ñ But you are farther than, far tonight ñ Am I wrong to feel this way? ñ Watching my tears fall down in the darkness ñ Until you see them all from a distance ñ And will you come to me and make them go away? ñ A little closer now, is where you need to be. (2x) ñ A little closer now. (3x) ñ Am I wrong to want you near?

This is how the story ends and begins again ñ Born from the sun, we never forget, we never forgive ñ White gives way to green, wind gives way to rain ñ Our hearts relieved a new chapter written ñ So much we want to do, so many opportunities ñ Not knowing where I begin and where this ends ñ Alone and unaware, stumbling like a newborn into the world ñ Where some seasons pass and others remain
I can't decide which way I'm going ñ So I look which way the river is flowing ñ I kick my feet, the path untrodden ñ But my footsteps, they will soon not be forgotten ñ I can't decide which way I'm going ñ So I look which way the river is flowing ñ I kick my feet, the path untrodden ñ But my footsteps, they will soon not be forgotten
Your eyes are open for me to see now ñ Walking on the shores of goodbye ñ Scholastica by the desert river ñ Has life ever treated you unkind? ñ While you were praying ñ I went to see the river ñ The dirt under my feet is gone ñ In the teeming alleyway there's a song
Just in time for me to put on a smile. ill laugh along with you. we can put on our own show too. they all stare at the queen not the goof. ill jump at the chance to chance my time with you. fell right on my face. caught staring into the sun. my eyes got burnt with my pride. my heart
If heartaches brought fame in love's crazy game ñ I'd be a legend in my time ñ If they gave gold statuettes for tears and regrets ñ I'd be a legend in my time ñ But they don't give awards, and there's no praise or fame ñ For hearts that are broken for love that's in vain ñ If loneliness meant world acclaim ñ Everyone would know my name ñ I'd be a legend in my time
Take a lover's nap ñ Shut your little trap ñ It's a pleasure cruise ñ When you're born to lose ñ And if I told you so ñ Would you act like you know? ñ  ñ And at the driving range ñ You shouted, "Fire away" ñ I started feeling strange ñ Thought of taking my life ñ And then I told you so ñ I fucking told you so
Those who trust in the Lord ñ Are a strong mountain ñ They will not...not be moved ñ Those who trust in the Lord ñ Are as Mount Zion ñ They will not...not be moved ñ Christ the King, He sets my feet ñ On a firm foundation ñ They will not...not be moved ñ Though the world moves like mad ñ You alone are faithful ñ Jesus, you, you will not be changed
I'm always here ñ Waiting for you all alone ñ Eyes of the night ñ Just to see, see you home ñ There's two of us in here ñ The only, only ñ There's two of us in here ñ And it's only ñ I'm always here ñ All alone without you now ñ Lights of the night ñ Just to see you somehow ñ There's two of us in here ñ The only, only ñ There's two of us in here ñ And it's only ñ Just you wait ñ Just you wait ñ Just you wait ñ Just you wait ñ If you run ñ If you run ñ If you run ñ I'll wait, I'll wait ñ I'll wait, I'll wait ñ I'll wait, I'll wait
Over hill, over dale, ñ Thorough bush, thorough brier, ñ Over park, over pale, ñ Thorough flood, thorough fire! ñ I do wander everywhere, ñ Swifter than the moon's sphere; ñ And I serve the Fairy Queen, ñ To dew her orbs upon the green; ñ The cowslips tall her pensioners be; ñ In their gold coats spots you see; ñ Those be rubies, fairy favours; ñ In those freckles live their savours; ñ I must go seek some dewdrops here, ñ And hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear.
The silence is unusually loud ñ Tonight ñ The strange sound of nothing ñ Fills my ears ñ Then night rushes in ñ Like a crowd of nights ñ And the ghost of our old love appears ñ This strange world of darkness ñ That comes with the night ñ Grows darker when it walks my way ñ And it laughs while I listen ñ For the breaking of day ñ And the ghost of our old love goes away

I'm an empty, vain shell ñ Detached and stricken ñ Bereft of richness from your faith ñ Restrain this runt ñ Neutralise this runt ñ Behead this runt amid pillars of salt ñ Knives out and poised ñ The balanced fall - consumed ñ And onto their own blades ñ Restrain this runt ñ Neutralise this runt ñ Behead this runt amid pillars of salt ñ Disabled in limbo ñ Enabled if I stand down ñ And fall onto my own blade

Mr. Black Panther Party, are you ready for me? After 25 years of silence, can you see me? I hate the cops about as much as you, and if you'll stand up for me, I'll stand up for you. We'll go marching arm in arm, we dont mean no harm, we're just protecting our rights from you know who.

I don't know what love is anymore, but ñ My heart is violently and tragically soft for you ñ Like fingertips, like rain ñ Like an empty street in the morning ñ Like the bed we lay in with our aching bones ñ breathing in ñ breathing out ñ Pine and petrichor, whiskey and smoke ñ Your arms are quickly becoming my favourite home and ñ I wouldn't have it any other way
The sun inside your eyes sends me impossibly ñ Through seasons spilling fluid time like arteries of gold ñ Beside this tree of oak and moss most innocently ñ The sedentary song describes our willingness to lie ñ Between your red and golden skin most innocently ñ Together like two meadows one, too soon our course is run ñ In softness as in stone we find regretably ñ The solitary song describes our willingness to die
In the struggle for power, some ñ Facts are put in glorious disguise ñ With methods so foul, reality is ñ Hidden behind f**king bunch of lies! ñ The corrupt leaders are only fooling the youth ñ The future generations are restrained from the truth

Push and pull ñ It won't let go ñ Spin it round ñ I wanna feel something ñ Release the essence ñ From the bottle of life ñ Twisting through the memories ñ Breaking up inside ñ Starting with my senses ñ Strip me to the core ñ Peeling off the pieces ñ Till i'm no... ñ Deep deep down ñ To the lost and found ñ Wrapped up in cases ñ Looking for beginnings ñ Push and pull ñ It won't let go ñ Simplify existence ñ Stricken to submission ñ Starting with my senses ñ Strip me to the core ñ Peeling off the pieces ñ Till i'm no ñ More
I've built my little castle ñ Based on apathy ñ And now I'm truly armed ñ Against insecurity ñ Stone cold thoughts ñ Behind a grieving mask ñ Furious eyes ñ Analysing silly lies ñ Ferousious grey mass ñ Non-believing in a cross ñ An aim so insane ñ The last leaf must be slain ñ A wood-chopping sound ñ Goes in my head around ñ The tree that once stood ñ Has now been chopped for good

The stars are always there ñ And praying towards the shorline ñ Collapsed into the crests ñ Where drowning is the best ñ Join hands as we walk to the water ñ Our lights turned out for a while ñ Sucked in by the sinking sand ñ I must let go ñ Your hand ñ Don't look down
Neck deep we wallow and this floor catches lingering feet ñ By rope with heartbreak this is our happiest moment of all ñ We dream of flowers on the razorwire ñ And wake to the scent of our dead ñ We're sinking ñ And all of those times don't matter here ñ Remember my love ñ This is for the sinking and the strength of our wings ñ Be brave and bleed out the day ñ We left our body for the sky and ended up here ñ Listen to me, don't let them list your feet ñ Our love is real

In the garden I'm told ñ Before I was born ñ In the still working morning ñ The seed was sown ñ Of the lamb and the lion ñ From maiden I'm told ñ She wore her hair ñ Around her neck ñ At the foot of the bed ñ Where I've been kept ñ The sea of white roses ñ Where lower things crept ñ In the black night ñ In the garden behold ñ The overgrown ñ Weeds and wild flowers ñ Swallowed them both ñ Where they moved with their maker ñ To them, now they're ghosts ñ In the black night
I gathered all the wrong decisions ñ I buried them deep beneath my skin ñ The blood underneath your nails discloses ñ You dug them up again ñ Now we walked around this garden ñ But you were not supposed, no ñ To shake the very tree from where my naked innocence grows ñ But all that you are is what I am ñ Now the doors unlock ñ Where's much of that perfume ñ But if these pretty walls could talk ñ The sick breath would fill the room ñ And all that you are is what I am
You promised me the Moon ñ You promised me a miracle ñ But life can be so cruel ñ I've put my trust in you ñ You promised me the Moon ñ You promised me a miracle ñ But I've been such a fool ñ To put my trust in you ñ I have been such a fool ñ You promised me the Moon ñ You promised me a miracle ñ But I've been such a fool ñ To put my trust in you ñ I have been such a fool
Wave to the ocean, flag of the ancient harbour ñ Rise with the morning, flying in the sundown ñ Low, as the evening calls fill the city market ñ Sink from the sky when the day is done, oh ñ  ñ Blood of the desert pours out like holy water ñ Heart of the mountain, beating like a drum ñ From dry river valleys, back down the royal highway ñ Out to the sea, where the night has come
Separation from the body of Christ ñ Town divided in numerous districts ñ The globe all covered be wanderers. They roam with no direction ñ The holy land, the promised land - your time will come and they will be returned ñ "Attach us to your graceful limbs, the pierced palms ñ Should our ways diverge, we will be doomed to our deadly fate."
It's recording ñ Okay ñ  really vibrate with the piano ñ Yeah it sounds cool ñ Okay ñ  ñ Everywhere I go ñ Swallowed up inside ñ Everywhere I go ñ Swallowed up inside ñ Everywhere I go ñ Swallowed up inside ñ Everywhere I go ñ Swallowed up inside
Thank you for your couch, I had no intention of imposing ñ Again the words were flowing like wine... ñ I know you're really tired, but I need some information ñ Just a little patentience and time ñ Peace of mind ñ Is it really finished? ñ Could I call you now and then? ñ Only as a friend... would you mind? ñ Shall I simply go now? ñ Shall I walk out of your life? ñ Just want to make you happy... i'll try ñ Peace of mind ñ (Dare to take the mask off. Peace of mind. This is all I ask.)
It's late ñ And I'm fighting the monsters under my bed ñ Spinning me around ñ And round ñ And all come out in the wash ñ These tired eyes ñ This tired mind ñ These tired lungs of mine ñ Lullaby ñ Roll on ñ Sunshine, winter, roll on ñ Sunshine, winter, roll on ñ Sunshines, winter roll on ñ Roll on ñ Roll on!
East of the sun and west of the moon ñ We'll build a dream house of love ñ Near to the sun in a day, near to the moon at night ñ We'll live in a lovely way dear ñ Living our love in memory ñ Just you and I, forever and a day ñ Love will not die, we'll keep it that way ñ Up among the stars we'll find ñ A harmony of life, too lovely tune ñ East of the sun and west of the moon, dear ñ East of the sun and west of the moon ñ Just you and I we'll build a dream house so lovely
No tomorrow... ñ Keep it now (repeat)
My words will pierce through you ñ My plotting will demolished you ñ Control is an illusion ñ All order will fall ñ You will beckon my call ñ It's I who stand tall ñ Divide et impera ñ The world will be taken in ñ You'll kneel for the king ñ You can never win ñ My omniscient rule ñ Divine intervention? ñ I laugh in your face
Last July stole the stars out of our eyes ñ And left us with the night ñ And we ran out of light ñ A slow slide from one to the other side ñ Beneath an empty sky ñ And running out of time ñ Reasons subtract and divide ñ But there's no reason to stay ñ There's nothing left to save ñ Are we breaking up? ñ Breaking up ñ Should we break up? ñ Break up ñ I'm falling off of my bike ñ And we fell asleep when we turned 23 ñ When did we both realize ñ That all our summer songs ñ Could only last so long?
So just clean it! Polish, scrub, bleach! ñ Mr. Sheen it! Reveal that clean layer ñ And conceal it! Don't get dirt on me ñ So just clean it! ñ So just clean it! Polish, scrub, bleach! ñ Mr. Sheen it!

Lyrics Missing
A tender child of summers three ñ At night, while seeking her little bed ñ Paused on the dark stair timidly ñ Oh, mother take my hand, said she ñ And then the dark will be light... ñ We older children grope our way ñ From dark behind to dark before; ñ And only when our hands we lay ñ In Thine, O God! the night is day ñ And there is darkness never more
For as long as times existence ñ I've struggled with my own persistence ñ Blanketed by deceit and willing ñ Stalking your young ñ As you kept on breeding filth upon filth ñ It never ends annihilation ñ Humanities only escape angels ñ Surrounding another victim ñ (as it all begins to fade) ñ Warfare consisting of frequencies ñ Unbearable to your nervous system ñ Existing far beyond your won intentions ñ And still you can't see the power
With all I'm holding inside ñ With all hopes and desires ñ And all the dreams that I've dreamt ñ With all I'm hoping to be ñ And all that the world will bring ñ And all that fails to compare ñ You say You want all of me ñ I wouldn't have it any other way ñ I've got a Saviour and He's living in me ñ WHOA ñ I wana know ñ I wana know You today ñ And You're the best thing that has happened to me ñ And the world will never take ñ The world will never take You away ñ No-one could ever take You away

Looking under the ghost on your face ñ Kind of ruins it for me ñ I don't want to see you toss it's hair ñ No I don't need you to show me its smile ñ You see because I'm learning ñ Yes I know about your mask ñ So I no longer have to ask ñ If I can peek behind the ghost on your face ñ That really ruins it for me ñ I don't want to clap and stare ñ While you show me the expressions it makes ñ You see because I'm learning ñ Yes I know about your mask ñ So I no longer have to ask ñ "Was your face a head in the pillow case?"
In the way water still loves the coastline ñ Your summer eyes, lazy, eye me up and down ñ I slow down, slow... ñ  ñ Summer lies, coast to coast we fly ñ Nevermind, no time for time ñ  ñ Seize the day, you know I will ñ Say it like a rhyme ñ This summer life, easy, cycles round and round ñ I slow down, slow... ñ I slow down, slow... ñ  x2 ñ  ñ I slow down, slow... ñ I slow down, slow... ñ I slow down, slow... ñ I slow down, slow...
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas ñ Just like the ones I used to know ñ Where the treetops glisten ñ And children listen ñ To hear sleigh bells in the snow ñ I'm dreaming of a white Christmas ñ With every Christmas card I write ñ May your days be merry and bright ñ And may all your Christmases be white ñ I'm dreaming of a white Christmas ñ With every Christmas card I write ñ May your days be merry and bright ñ And may all your Christmases be white
Walking down dusty roads ñ Looking for horny toads ñ With the sun on my face ñ Thinking about people past ñ Memories that never last ñ When you're young and naive ñ Chorus ñ Time ain't nothing ñ When you're young at heart ñ And your soul still burns ñ I've seen rainy days ñ Sunshine that never fades ñ All through the night ñ Had a motorcycle at 10 ñ Never got into heroin ñ I guess I want to live ñ Gonna get a house someday ñ Find a wife raise a family ñ But don't mean you have to die ñ Chorus
Fire deters from death, for the dream of our death ñ Under a pledge of secrecy, the night will fall into water ñ Under the veil of secrecy, we will join together again ñ On the verge of tears before long: the sky will dive into water
I cannot think of a Reason ñ A Question without an Answer ñ An Answer I can't give ñ I am the silent Witness ñ To all Misery ñ Created by Lies and Deceit ñ I can't find ñ The missing Pieces of this Puzzle ñ Puzzle I am ñ I still can't speak ñ A silent Witness forever ñ On a Quest for the Answer ñ I seek ñ Even others cannot help ñ For they have no Sight ñ Of what's Inside ñ Talking ain't no Solution ñ Because they don't see ñ What the reason is ñ The Reason of Being me ñ I cannot think of a Reason ñ That's the question
Once more ñ Forever 'till the end of time ñ Forever found ñ Think what you may, but honey I ain't blind ñ Lost in the shuffle like a child all alone ñ Count my days for the end is my home ñ Once more ñ Forever 'till the end of time ñ Oh ñ Once more ñ I kill myself again ñ Once more ñ I'm a slave to the goddamn end ñ Lost in the shuffle like a child all alone ñ Counting my days for the end is my home ñ Once more ñ Forever 'till the end of time ñ Oh

Verse: ñ From golden fields ñ To oceans blue ñ From green mountain meadows ñ I'll think of You ñ From rolling hills ñ With misty moon ñ From roaring rivers ñ I'll think of You ñ And everywhere you remind me ñ You are and ñ You were and ñ You will ñ Always be ñ And You are and ñ You were and ñ You will ñ Always be our God
A sun that never sets burns on ñ New light is this river's dawn ñ When to speak of a word so old ñ Is to relearn what is known ñ A time to think back and move on ñ Rebuild the loves of lives long gone ñ The blood that flows through me is not my own ñ The blood is from the past, not my own ñ The blood that leads my life is not my own ñ The blood is my strength, I'm not alone
My parade marched down my street with muscle cars and old beauty queens ñ Choirs sing and children following the sound ñ My blueprint for what not to be ñ Then he turns and bows to the crowd ñ And bless the folks with pearls from his mouth ñ As he speaks he starts to float off into space ñ Handlebar mustache on his face ñ Sometime ñ You might ñ You might ñ My parade marched into to the sea ñ Rusted cars and old movie screens ñ Candy coins and people following the sound ñ My blueprint for what not to be
Hush now--don't explain ñ Just say you'll remain ñ I'm glad you're back ñ Don't explain ñ Quiet--don't explain ñ What is there to gain? ñ Skip that lipstick ñ Don't explain ñ You know that I love you ñ And what endures ñ All my thoughts of you ñ For I'm so completely yours ñ Cry to hear folks chatter ñ And I know you cheat ñ Right or wrong, don't matter ñ When you're with me, sweet ñ Hush now--don't explain ñ You're my joy and pain ñ My life's yours, love ñ Don't explain
Curtain call cadaver, crowded neighborhood ñ The train just rolls on by, I bid adieu ñ Speak of evil, worship what you will ñ Come and chop their heads off, right ñ We have had enough, we want your flesh ñ We wait ñ The devil comes to town ñ Hide your kids away ñ They might find themselves a world away ñ Martian, there it be ñ Bring her brain to the sort your DNA ñ A pale white horse collides straight into me ñ We wait
Lover, give me what you got ñ I'm a passenger and you're holding my heart ñ Good reason, but I'm down on luck ñ Never seeing just what it was ñ Lover, give me what you got ñ I'm a passenger and you're holding my heart ñ Good reason, but I'm down on luck ñ Never seeing just what it was ñ Give me what you got ñ Give me what you got
All of You is more than enough for ñ All of me for every thirst and every need ñ You satisfy me with Your love ñ And all I have in You ñ Is more than enough ñ You are my supply ñ My breath of life ñ Still more awesome than I know ñ You are my reward ñ Worth living for ñ Still more awesome than I know ñ You're my sacrifice of greatest price ñ Still more awesome than I know ñ You're my coming King You're everything ñ Still more awesome than I know

We have come full circle, subservient to our self inflicted automation that disregards genuine anguish and promotes synthetic indifference. Not of flesh and blood but of gears and cams fueled by submission. We choke on individuality and suffocate under procession
I know, I alone ñ How much it hurts, this heart ñ With no faith nor law ñ No melody or thought ñ Only I, only I ñ And none of this can I say ñ Because feeling is like the sky ñ Seen, nothing in it to see
So little to say ñ So urgent ñ to say it
(Instrumental) ñ We spent the summer together ñ Walking on the beach for your dad ñ Uh huh ñ I had my friends, I had my friends ñ You had your attitude ñ (Alright) ñ I couldn't stand your voice ñ Back in august and during the day ñ But then we hung out, we made out ñ I think I'm falling for you ñ The first time I said I loved you ñ Was the last time I saw your face ñ But then I never wanna go, never wanna go ñ Never wanna go home ñ (Okay) ñ (Instrumental)
Lyrics for this song have yet to be released
Warm feet pressed on glass, soaking in the sun ñ Any second though, the clouds cover it up ñ Water on the stove ñ Spider on my toe ñ One split second thought ñ Says she's all I've got
I've had nothing but sorrow ñ Since you said we were through ñ There's no hope for tomorrow ñ How's the world treating you? ñ  ñ Every sweet thing that mattered ñ Has been broken in two ñ All my dreams have been shattered ñ How's the world treating you? ñ  ñ Got no plans for next Sunday ñ Got no plans for today ñ Every day is blue Monday ñ Every day you're away ñ  ñ Every sweet thing that mattered ñ Has been broken in two ñ And I'm asking you, darling ñ How's the world treating you?
Get the girl, them's the rules ñ In this world you win or lose ñ The girl gets the right to choose ñ Who will win and who will lose ñ You get the girl, I lose ñ I get the girl, you lose ñ You get the girl, you win ñ You reproduce, Darwin ñ My descendants blown away ñ Your descendants here to stay ñ Zero sum idiot game
Baby ñ You're crying yourself to sleep again ñ Baby ñ How could they do this to you ñ Baby ñ It's all over your face tonight ñ Baby ñ It's just a matter of time ñ Baby ñ Cry yourself to sleep again ñ Baby ñ You give it all away ñ Maybe ñ This is the way it ends tonight ñ Baby ñ We all cry alone ñ Baby ñ Cry yourself to sleep again ñ Baby ñ The past is your only friend tonight ñ Maybe ñ Your life is only a dream tonight ñ Baby ñ We all cry alone
My body stopped moving ñ And quickly got cold ñ I made my escape through exhaling lungs ñ And watched my body rot away ñ  ñ Nobody noticed my misty escape ñ And I ended up floating like water in the air ñ To a blowy oceanside above the pounding of waves ñ That's when you showed up on the foggiest day ñ  ñ From high above you ñ I saw your earthling body wrapped in wool ñ The glow surrounds you ñ And when you breathed in, I felt the pull ñ Aaaah.... ñ Aaaah... ñ Aaaah... ñ Aaaah...
There is a pain that comes ñ From holding on too long ñ A subtle knife that scrapes the veins ñ We both know i'm leaving ñ I'm already gone ñ Even if i'm here today ñ The line that defines ñ The shape of our lives ñ Slowly bleeds into gray ñ The line that divides ñ This world from my mind ñ Can only lead me away ñ This ever present terror ñ Of what each day will bring ñ That i won't find the strength ñ To live ñ Alive enough to see ñ Just how far away i am ñ From where i really need to be
Truth to existence ñ I found in my dreams ñ Yet I saw, in the fields of souls ñ Doubt in the glimpse of an eye ñ Among the many I found the few ñ And none could foresee the coming of their fate ñ Bewildered by confusion ñ Fearing what they knew ñ They choose to remain restrained ñ Grieved I was to the depths of my soul ñ For I could not reverve the tide ñ By tragic mourns for the vile ñ I cleansed my essence, and thus became divine
Fight ñ  ñ  ñ Fight

My heart's on fire ñ I'm alive ñ I've got wings of my own ñ Something new something fresh ñ Indsestructible and fragile ñ Make amends ñ I softly call ñ Call on you ñ I don't know ñ What it takes to get through ñ Holy mother here inside ñ You left your temple with your gold ñ Please let this all be remembered ñ Don't cast it upon another ñ This daydream is growing old ñ It's night but I'm not cold ñ Maybe my horses are a little bit high ñ Or maybe I'm easy and you are going blind
Get on strike! ñ When the bastards take you up at the station ñ Questions hole into your head ñ They wanna name you detailed information ñ While they're treating you like shit ñ When you got the boot at home, get dressed up ñ Give 'em bollocks, crop your hair ñ And when they try to rip you off in the classroom ñ Just refuse it to go there
I'll watch you go ñ into the dark ñ where I cannot follow anymore ñ I'll hold your hand ñ across the bridge ñ who will be there waiting there for me? ñ I'll understand ñ when you break free ñ but I will be a beacon in the dark ñ I will be a beacon in the dark ñ I, I will be a beacon in the dark ñ I'll watch you slip away (x4)
We are still hearing the same ñ Still repeating unknown ñ Time just moves on and gone ñ Wondering if change will ever come 
Early one morning ñ Just as the sun was rising ñ I heard a maid sing ñ In the valley below ñ  ñ O, don't deceive me ñ O, never leave me ñ How could you use ñ A poor maiden so? ñ  ñ Gay is the garland ñ And fresh are the roses ñ Ive culled from the garden ñ To place upon thy brow ñ  ñ  ñ Remember the vows ñ That you made to your Mary ñ Remember the bower ñ Where you vowed to be true ñ  ñ  ñ Thus sang the poor maiden ñ Her sorrows bewailling ñ Thus sang the poor maid ñ In the valley bellow
Sit with me on the sidewalk, I wanna know your name ñ We can play or we can just talk, I wanna know your game ñ You seem nice, you seem cool ñ La la la la la la
You and me, we go together ñ When you're near, life's just better ñ Woah-oah, oah-oah-oah ñ I'm home ñ  ñ Far away, we could go somewhere ñ Wouldn't change as long as you're right here ñ Woah-oah, oah-oah-oah ñ I'm home ñ Let's just stay how we are ñ I'll never let you go ñ Just hold on to my heart until we're getting older ñ  ñ 'Cause you're my home, home ñ My home, my home ñ 'Cause you're my home, home ñ My home, my home ñ  ñ You and me, we go together ñ When you're near, life's just better ñ Woah-oah, oah-oah-oah ñ I'm home, I'm home
Here it comes ñ In and out and around ñ Feeling bare, almost there ñ Here it comes ñ This is the best part ñ This is the best part ñ Getting weak ñ But I'm doing fine ñ How are you? How are you? ñ Everything and nothing ñ Twirling around in my head ñ All at once, all at once ñ  ñ Where am I going? ñ Can you take me with you? ñ Can you take me with you?
Joy, joy is the giving ñ Give to everybody ñ Joy! ñ Joy! ñ War, war is the ego ñ Of man's repressed libido ñ Love! ñ Love! ñ Feel the love ñ Hear the love ñ See the love ñ Please! ñ Please! ñ Please! ñ Love, love is the mother ñ God, god is the human ñ You, the generator ñ Please! ñ Please! ñ Peace, peace is the giving ñ A piece for everybody ñ Please! ñ Please! ñ Feel you love ñ Hear you love ñ See you love ñ Love!

Once more I'll take you for a ride ñ Don't care who've you been ñ I've got a secret for you ñ A ticket to hide ñ Ooohhh... ñ You gotta funny name  ñ Don't worry, it never washes out ñ Don't Darlene

Each secret you keep ñ Keeps me a bit far ñ But I want to know ñ Burn down the mysteries ñ Though I know I won't ñ I'll never know it ñ I could never stand not being closer ñ How come ñ We argued again ñ You suggest I didn't grasp it ñ It got dark some time ago now ñ Now I'm lost ñ Where can I reach you ñ Get up get up get up
And when language corrodes ñ All our faculties falter and blur ñ Nobody knows how our tongues got so swollen and furred ñ What truths are there left to be told ñ When we're all lost for words?
Still got me on this piano shit ñ Yeah, I don't know, man ñ I didn't sign up for this shit
Lyrics from snippet ñ  ñ Gettin' out, this for us, feel like I'm Jordan Peele ñ EA, do 140 on the freeway ñ Turn up with my DJ, but only on my b-day ñ 'Cause I don't like the club at all ñ Remember the days they wouldn't play my songs at all ñ Now I gotta shrug it off
Parked in your car, you're safe, you're saved. and though your hands shake and your lungs ache and the belt chafes, somehow you're still safe. four feet up, the road just stops at a forty-foot drop, where your high beams catch the last seam before the air sinks over the black brink. you must have dozed. you came so close with your eyes closed. but somehow, you're alive now, and wide awake. your foot's still on the

Right now is the time for the tired and forgotten ñ Tired and forgotten ñ To turn in our legs, crippled from ñ Our own way and strength ñ And let us strap compassion to our chests ñ And run as if we never knew how until now ñ We will wear compassion ñ We will wear it on our chests ñ And sing with love at our throats ñ Like a child, it's all i know ñ Father, hide our hearts in you ñ Lest we steal them back ñ And lay them at the feet of men ñ I know now that glory has not a place ñ Near my hands or any man
Bastard's Lullaby ñ (Intro) ñ We're never hone, Sunday, Saturday, Friday, any day ñ I'm never home any, ah, we're never home ñ But if I ever was, I'd sit alone, in the living room ñ Drink the whiskey and listen to this guy play piano
No one can say ñ Where love will go ñ The change ñ Don't know if I ñ Am here or there ñ Don't even really ñ Know my name ñ Am I holding on ñ Am I holding on ñ Will it always ñ Be the way ñ And the lips that kiss ñ Can also kill ñ The change ñ The touch of love ñ Can take your soul ñ The change ñ I walk through walls ñ I am the gun
Airborne cattle ñ Dissected sections and quadrants ñ Complete abdominal extraction ñ Viscera intact and emptied ñ Drained of blood ñ Unsightly victim of government testing ñ Possible extraterrestrial experimentation ñ Mute forever ñ Now buzzing with larvae and flies ñ Biproduct of our bullshit existence ñ Cadavers for the spawning
We've got solid state technology ñ Tapes on the floor ñ Songs we can't afford to play ñ When we came here today ñ All I wanted to say was ñ How much I miss you ñ Alcohol and cotton balls ñ And some drugs ñ We can't afford on the way ñ When we came here today ñ I felt something true ñ Now I'm red-eyed and blue
Two cigarettes in an ashtray ñ My love and I in a small cafe ñ A stranger came along ñ And everything went wrong ñ Now there's three cigarettes ñ In an ashtray ñ I watched her take him from me ñ Now his love is no longer my own ñ Now they have gone ñ And I sit alone ñ And watch one cigarette ñ Burn away
Wash away ñ The lonely weeks made ñ And alone, my worried face ñ Is grey ñ Sipping on ñ The moments of the sun ñ And the waves ñ Of promise and waste ñ Wash away ñ The lonely weeks made ñ And talk of pretty sea waves ñ Of grey
Gangsters on the corner ñ Dem all fire gunshot ñ Police in adem uniform ñ They fire shots back ñ Innocent bystanders ñ Bite the bullet once again ñ With laws full of discrepancy ñ It's only us to blame ñ You say you want to work it out ñ Yet stick a gun into my mouth ñ An then you calmly shout ñ This worlds at peace ñ I shaully doubt ñ I see no equal rights or justice only ñ Pain ñ Dats running in your vain ñ Man made pain ñ An it's only us to blame ñ Oh well ñ The activists there on a mental rampage
Look down - look down ñ That lonesome road ñ Before you travel on ñ Look up - look up ñ And seek your maker ñ 'fore Gabriel blows his horn ñ Weary toting such a load ñ Trudging down - that lonesome road ñ Look down - look down ñ That lonesome road ñ Before you travel on ñ True love - true love ñ What have I done ñ That you should treat me so ñ You - caused me ñ To walk and talk ñ Like I never did before ñ Weary toting - such a load ñ Trudging down that lonesome road ñ Look down - look down ñ That lonesome road ñ Before you travel on
When you're down and you're out, I wanna be the one you turn to ñ Said you'd be here forever, you were mine, you never knew ñ Don't tell me you're sorry, get up and leave ñ You say "I seen it coming, you were too good for me" ñ I built my life around you, I'm in your hands ñ And if you drop me, it's all over ñ Please, don't wake me up, I can't bear to see you go ñ Somewhere far away in the not so distant future ñ That would mean everything to you when you'll be right here with me too
Goin' up, goin' down ñ Goin' up, down, down, up ñ Anyway you want me let it roll ñ Yeah, yeah, yeah ñ You've got me doin' what you want me ñ Baby what-cha want me to do? ñ Rock me baby, rock me all night long ñ Rock me baby, rock me all night long ñ I want 'cha to rock me baby, 'til my back ain't got no bone ñ I want 'cha to roll me, roll me like a wagon wheel ñ I want 'cha to roll me, baby, roll me like a wagon wheel ñ I want 'cha to roll me baby, 'til I'm in love with you

Old friends ñ Old friends ñ Sat on their park bench like bookends ñ A newspaper blown through the grass ñ Falls on the round toes ñ Of the high shoes ñ Of the old friends ñ Old friends ñ Winter companions, the old men ñ Lost in their overcoats, waiting for the sunset ñ The sounds of the city sift through the trees ñ Settle like dust ñ On the shoulders ñ Of the old friends ñ Old friends ñ Memory brushes the same years ñ Silently sharing the same fear
In his arms, locked in that iron grip nothing will reveal ñ Follow these footsteps and we will reach the bottom ñ I tumbled down the road that bears his name ñ Here he dwells, here he prospers and pushes us towards the end ñ When we are drifting against the tide ñ Colliding with the very air we breathe ñ Somewhere the tracks inwards must lead out ñ A grasp of hope that defeats the will ñ Always pushed away ñ Always nothing
On a quiet afternoon ñ Staring out of your room ñ Feeling blue ñ What am I gonna do? ñ Look at me, just close your eyes ñ Try to realize ñ Look at me, just close your eyes ñ Try to realize ñ Coffee's there ñ On the floor ñ From the night before ñ Shades are drawn ñ Against the sun ñ Where is everyone? ñ Look at me, just close your eyes ñ Try to realize ñ Look at me, just close your eyes ñ Try to realize
An intervention of collective conscience ñ Cultivating the anomalies ñ Alterating in depth perception ñ Expanding upon reality ñ Improving enhancing pervading progress ñ Retracting codes of morality ñ A flawless unit of inherent perfection ñ Correcting the faults of humanity ñ Our elements become one ñ Endorse the transition ñ No lack of comprehending ñ Specifics of the philosophy ñ Attributions of human error ñ In contrast with proficiency
Whatever it takes ñ I know I can make it through ñ And if I hold out ñ I know I can make it through ñ Be the best ñ The best that I can be ñ Whatever it takes ñ I know I can make it ñ I can make it ñ I can make it through ñ I can make it through ñ I can make it through (I can make it) ñ Whatever it takes ñ I know I can make it through
Binding the soil ñ Seedless cryptogram ñ Devoid of flowers ñ Via spores it disperses ñ Genders entwined ñ As antherida and archegonia converge
A light shines above ñ A trace of the sky ñ Reflecting in my lover's eye ñ The sun going down ñ On a war, lost or won ñ All is silent in this newborn world of peace ñ We're the only ones awake to see ñ It's not a case of right and wrong ñ It's all about to be ñ You and me ñ So come and bless my soul ñ It's all about to be ñ A blue whippoorwill sings ñ On the other side of the rain ñ We're through with the games ñ We survived the hate and the pain ñ The storm's gone away ñ So come my kingdom come - come today
Your senseless theories ñ Are rising once again ñ Causing pain within my mind ñ - I'm losing the control ñ But in the kingdom to come ñ Behind the seven seas... ñ Beyond the distant valleys... ñ It's me who decides!!! ñ Your flaming thoughts... ñ ...are tearing my soul apart! ñ I'm harvesting... ñ ...the sow of your curse again! ñ You've destined me to suffer... ñ ...as you were the master! ñ You've taken my inner self... ñ Confusion will rule till I die!!!
It deshna dmula lono showa ñ I make up hundreds so always know how to make love ñ There, you can have my youth, it's not what I have loved ñ Start off to see him, not happily be ñ Tyearn abet yar atsad bedao ñ Drreol oh ñ Pasis disea mala faghat ama ñ And I have been so completely busy ñ Amentyao isna pagho ñ And your spangle, oh how it hurts, and I have had this feeling ñ Tyearn abet yar atsad bedao ñ Drreol oh ñ Tyearn abet yar atsad bedao ñ Drreol oh
Dark horse, don't stray off course ñ Just out of interest, do you have any interest ñ In acting the same, in feeling this way? ñ  ñ Do I keep on running in different directions? ñ I'll scatter the birds, head in the clouds ñ When getting lost ñ When getting lost is the only way ñ Return to the fray, that's where you'll find out ñ  ñ And I keep forgetting that you aren't real ñ When I remember, here comes the fear ñ It's taking forever, ready or not ñ It'll take even longer with one eye on the clock
Depravity favours the bold ñ  ñ Our sins are stubborn ñ Our repentance weak ñ Lavish our confessions ñ Sins cleansed by tears ñ Everyday a step closer towards Hell ñ Without horror, through gloom that stinks ñ  ñ If rape and poison, dagger and fire ñ Still not embroidered their pleasant designs ñ On banal canvas of our pitiable destinies ñ It is because our souls, alas, are not bold enough ñ ---
My kitchen's pretty small (but i don't complain) ñ I guess it would be nicer to have a little bit more space (come on let's stay sane) ñ I have more posters for my wall (keep it together) ñ I guess it's exciting to move on from this place (but we're not together)
Oh catfish girl ñ Make me feel so fine ñ Yeah, catfish girl ñ Always pulling on my line ñ When I see her smiling face ñ It get me every single time ñ Oh catfish girl ñ I miss you, Lord I feel so blue ñ Oh catfish girl ñ In every little thing that you do ñ Catfish girl ñ I only want to be with you ñ Oh catfish girl ñ I miss you, Lord I feel so blue ñ Catfish girl ñ In every little thing that you do ñ Oh catfish girl ñ I only want to be with you

My ghost is ñ Always hungry ñ My soul is over apart ñ Train lines ñ Going nowhere ñ No destination found ñ Is this a final home? ñ Compensation ñ Delivery undone ñ And thanks for all this ñ Trying to listen ñ Remembering a kill ñ Train lines ñ Going nowhere ñ No destination found ñ We'll leave this world ñ Just as we found it ñ We'll leave this place alone ñ Star aligns ñ On a hill slide ñ Everyone alone ñ Train lines ñ Going nowhere ñ No destination found
When love comes in ñ And takes you for a spin ñ Ooh, la, la, la, c'est magnifique ñ When every night ñ Your loved one holds you tight ñ Ooh, la, la, la, c'est magnifique ñ But when one day ñ Your loved one drifts away ñ Ooh, la, la, la, it is so tragique ñ But when once more ñ She whispers "Je t'adore ñ C'est magnifique"
Drawing anarchy signs on your pencil case is stupid ñ Sorry, I take it back ñ It's just redundant
When the songs of night lead you far away ñ When the tears of sadness leave your heart betrayed ñ Draped in memories, armed with earthly fire ñ Promise all you can, for it's the moons desire ñ As the days unfold, falling one by one ñ As the dawn of sorrow, aches the lonely sun ñ Lost in melodies, sworn to secrets there ñ Torn from hope and life to end your days in fear
Salvation ñ Soul searching for lost innocence ñ I feel it coming, I feel it coming ñ Coming in waves, coming in waves ñ Created my own world ñ Created my own world ñ The angels they carry me ñ The angels they carry me ñ It's such a long way home ñ Salvation ñ I feel it coming ñ Coming in waves, coming in waves ñ Created my own world ñ Created my own world ñ The angels they carry me ñ The angels they carry me ñ It's such a long way home ñ It's such a long way home ñ Such a long way home ñ It's such a long way home

Bend, don't break ñ The wounds you hide ñ Fence away ñ For something you won't find ñ  ñ What is the answer? ñ What is the answer? ñ  ñ Flush and burst ñ Cut to my ends ñ Tear it down ñ Force it to begin ñ  ñ What is the answer? ñ What is the answer? ñ  ñ Hard, hard to take ñ Ripped at the seams ñ Some ports deep ñ Forget it at best ñ  ñ What is the answer? ñ What is the answer? ñ  ñ Push it all back
See her colored in brown ñ Tinted in gold ñ Lovely and fine she seems ñ Hear her laughing at me ñ Bringing me tea ñ Melt in solarian beams ñ Accidentally ñ Ecubyan ñ I see the sun ñ You call it dawn ñ Feel her warm as the sun ñ Cold as the moon ñ Lovely and fine ñ She seems ñ See her frowning at me ñ Bringing me tea ñ Melt in solarian beams ñ Accidentally ñ Ecubyan ñ I see the sun ñ You call it dawn ñ Smile your mercurial smile ñ You are quickly gone
Oooooo ñ If you would put your hand in mine ñ Lose all track of time ñ We could find a way ñ Leave this world behind ñ The moon is shining bright ñ Tender is the night for love ñ Let's turn out the lights ñ 'Cuz tender is the night for love ñ The moon is shining bright ñ Tender is the night for love
And the slow hours you forget ñ Dress rehearsals, learnt the lines and walk the set ñ Your leading man delayed ñ Upstaged and scratched to fate ñ So outside and after ñ Just you and him and a 100 drunken extras ñ You murmured you would ñ Held his eyes a second longer ñ So if he ever comes late again ñ I think I could take his place ñ He said I looked the part ñ I said you should have asked ñ Sure
Lyrics from snippet ñ Hey, I'ma visit the sky today ñ Hey, I'ma dance on the clouds today ñ And make it rain, on everybody beneath us ñ Just 'cause they try, doesn't mean they can be us ñ No, nobody can be us
Smash! now again ñ Nobodys going to make you do nothing you dont not want to do ñ The buttons all ready to be pushed ñ Its just a matter of when, if at all. 
Wind of God come blow up on us ñ Breath of God come breathe within us now ñ Within us now ñ Spirit of God come fall upon us ñ Like a fire, rise within us now ñ Within us now ñ Love of God come fall upon us ñ Like a blanket, wrap around us now ñ Around us now
I got up this morning ñ Put on my shoes ñ Tied my shoes ñ Went to the mirror ñ For to comb my hair ñ I made a move ñ Know what to do ñ Try to break and run ñ  ñ Baby, this ain't me ñ Baby, this ain't me ñ Grown so ugly ñ Grown so ugly ñ Don't even know myself ñ Don't even know myself ñ  ñ Left Angola, 1964 ñ Walking down the street ñ Knock upon my baby's door ñ My baby come out ñ And ask me who I am ñ I say "Honey ñ Honey, don't you know your man?" ñ She said "My man been gone ñ Since 1942 ñ And I tell you, Mr. Ugly ñ He didn't look like you!"
Come be a Shakespearean fish with me ñ Shakespearean fish swim the sea ñ Very far from land ñ Romantic fish swim in nets ñ Coming to the hand ñ What are all those fish that lie ñ What are all those fish that cry ñ What are all those fish that lie ñ Gasping on the strand...
Bang-bang, my brain ain't feel the same ñ Feelin' like my nervous system's shuttin' down ñ Ain't got no shots, it do me now ñ  ñ Real niggas never meet the reaper ñ Yeah, real niggas shock you to my sleepers ñ  ñ The block stay hot, world keep spinnin' ñ This that, 'Fuck the blocks'
I've been chasing a love ñ That can't be found ñ Stuck in the same old groove ñ But I won't break down ñ Just going round and around ñ And around ñ Thats the way I keep this wheel turning ñ To save my soul from any more searching ñ I tell myself that loves just another word ñ That don't mean much to me in this world ñ If just for a while my heart ñ Was in your hands ñ I've learned all the lessons ñ My time can stand ñ My faith is gone ñ But i go on and on
The night's always waiting ñ Still and unseen ñ The harder you focus ñ The darker it seems
Please exit the music business, punk ñ  ñ You suffer...But why?
The truth is underneath the stories yet to tell ñ You came a long way, but your eyes won't tell ñ I started to talk 'cause I wanted to know ñ Is the grass that greener or as burnt as here? ñ I'd like to know ñ I'd really like to know ñ I'd like to know ñ I'd really like to know ñ Does knowledge make stronger? ñ Does learning make proud? ñ Have we seen too much? ñ You kept it inside ñ You kept it inside ñ I'd like to know ñ I'd really like to know ñ I'd like to know ñ I'd really like to know
Blue Boy ñ Miscellaneous ñ Remember Me ñ Remember me, I'm the one who had your babies ñ ***Note: This is the only line in this song. It is repeated several times
Finn, why are you fighting with your friend? ñ Jake, you know this can't be the end ñ Romance or action, does not matter ñ Hurting your friends will make you sadder ñ  ñ Guys, you know you're much more than this ñ You two, please stop, or you'll undo ñ All that you've been through, ooo ñ Just hug and it's agreed ñ Your love will not delete

She tells me she's seen the great deceiver ñ Every time she looks away ñ He's waiting there to receive her ñ He's gonna wait all day ñ From some dark corner the Fiddler starts to play ñ His yellow eyes watch the dance begin ñ I've been walking all day, my soles wear thin ñ Yea, from walking away ñ She tells me she's seen the great deceiver ñ Every time she looks away ñ I must admit I know believe her ñ I've seen those dancers sway ñ To the haunting song he plays

I take seven nerves from your skin to sew them on myself ñ I take several knifes from the skin to slowly harm myself ñ I take seven hairs from my head to contort your health ñ I take your tattoo and sew it on my face
Bolan ñ Whilst flying over the midnight sky ñ I saw my girl with another man ñ A wild anger I'd never shown ñ Bite, when I saw him hold her hand ñ The penninsular of night explodes ñ As I loaded my head and barked she'd been untrue ñ And I slowly unzipped the heavens ñ And asked my main man what to do ñ He said breeze and dip like lightening ñ Across the meadows of the sea ñ And know that I've know your existence ñ And tell all your dudes astutely that you've hung out with me
Raw vein ñ Gyal ñ  ñ Cocky longer than me pants foot
I took my baby out to dinner ñ So we could get a bite to eat ñ And though we both had ñ Looked so much thinner ñ She looked so beautiful I ñ Could eat her ñ I took my baby to a big film ñ So we could watch the ñ English die ñ We both were nervous feeling dizzy ñ And neither one of us knew just why ñ We sat and talked about revolution ñ Just like two rivers in the sun ñ We sat and talked about revolution ñ And how the hell we could get things done
You get to choose ñ I get to lose ñ You get the goods ñ I pay the price ñ You do the crime ñ I do the time ñ What do I get ñ What do I get ñ What do I get ñ What do I get ñ You get the highs ñ I get the lows ñ You get the gain ñ I get the pain ñ You get the bomb ñ I get the fallout
Everything will not be made right ñ Everything will not be made right ñ It's childish I know ñ Pretend the world is listening ñ Ignore the sound for now ñ I just heard God give in ñ There's much to be left over ñ When we're swallowed by the end ñ The cockroaches and Darwin ñ Had a deal
Everything in your life is what you see ñ All these games we play are meant to be ñ Everything you do is what you do ñ It's all inside of being inside of you ñ  ñ I look up and around, I look down to the ground ñ And you can be a stranger in your town ñ  ñ Everything you see is what you are ñ You can travel near, or travel far ñ It's all a game, you know, and that's for sure ñ And now, you've found out how, you still want more ñ  ñ I look up and around, I look down to the ground ñ And you can be a stranger in your town
The calloo's spirits are low ñ Swimming on the chill water ñ But the orphan's are lower ñ Walking down the village street ñ The sparrow's belly is chill ñ Sitting on the icy bough ñ But my belly is more chill ñ As I step from glade to glade ñ  ñ The dove's heart is cold ñ As it pecks the village rick ñ But I'm colder still ñ As I drink the icy water ñ The dove's heart is cold ñ As it pecks the village rick ñ But I'm colder still ñ As I drink the icy water

There's no running from this ñ Will there ever be a way? ñ Had to try to survive today ñ Just survive ñ Troubles rising inside ñ Barreling into the landslide ñ Can't hold onto my mind ñ No escape from the fire ñ Black sun rises on me ñ Shadows gather around ñ Troubles rising inside ñ Barreling into the landslide ñ Can't hold onto my mind ñ No escape from the fire ñ Take, take all that I have ñ Awake, I have nothing left ñ Take, take all you can ñ Make, make me half a man
You're my thrill ñ You do something to me ñ You send chills right through me ñ When I look at you ñ 'Cause you're my thrill ñ You're my thrill ñ How my pulse increases ñ I just go to pieces ñ When I look at you ñ 'Cause you're my thrill ñ Hmmm-nothing seems to matter ñ Hmmm-here's my heart on a silver platter ñ Where's my will ñ Why this strange desire ñ That keeps morning higher ñ When I look at you ñ I cann't keep still ñ You're my thrill
I came down from Butte, Montana ñ For a little change of scene ñ And I stopped to stay in Santa Fe ñ Where I met a pretty queen ñ Hair of gold, eyes of blue ñ Lips like cherry wine ñ She's the prettiest gal I ever know and I'm gonna make her mine ñ Now I planned to leave on Monday ñ But she held me kinda tight ñ So I stood my ground and hung around ñ And then I left on Friday night ñ Oh, hair of gold, eyes of blue ñ Lips like cherry wine ñ The prettiest gal I ever knew and I'm gonna make her mine

Happy birthday Julie ñ My, it's good to see you, gal ñ The last time I saw you smile you were still my pal ñ Yeah, I sure did love you ñ But somehow you slipped away ñ Now isntead of lovin' you ñ I'm reminiscin' on your birthday ñ (refrain) ñ Do you remember those warm summer nights when the stars hang in the air? ñ I didn't have a dime to my name, but you didn't care ñ Now you've gotten married and everything has changed ñ But happy birthday Julie just the same ñ (Repeat refrain) ñ Yes happy birthday Julie just the same
You! My nightmare ñ You! My black air ñ Without blame I was betrayed ñ I feel the rage ñ As a wild gale ñ Biting all my lanes ñ I'll tell you bye! With a hand ñ In my face a big smile ñ Revenge has begun... ñ A sea of hate surrounds me ñ You thrust a dagger on my back ñ From now on till the end of all times ñ You! my enemy ñ Enemy always be... ñ You don't cross my way because ñ You are my enemy ñ Hating your name ñ Scoring yourself ñ In your world of lies and shame ñ I have to fight ñ And to survive in this game
So I pushed him in the ocean so that he could feel again
I saw you in the blazing light ñ When the lotus caught fire in the middle of the night ñ  ñ It froze me ñ It froze me ñ  ñ I saw you coming closer real slow ñ You grabbed hold, I let go ñ Yeah, I saw you in the blazing light ñ I saw you, I saw you, all right ñ  ñ It froze me ñ It froze me ñ It froze me ñ It froze me
Fifteen hundred and thirteen people died unnecessarily ñ They shouldn't have died ñ If there had been enough lifeboats, they wouldn't have died ñ And I entirely endorse what Dr. Ballard said ñ His actual words were ñ "It is quiet and peaceful and a fitting place for the remains of this greatest of sea tragedies to rest" ñ "May it forever remain that way and may God bless these now-found souls"
The feeling that you get when we creep inside ñ You won't see us there, you won't feel our stare ñ But when we're next to you we do all we can do ñ To get the cold sweat out, watch you squirm about ñ And as you try to move we grab and strangle you ñ With all of your deceit and our reality ñ Night ñ Nightmares ñ In the night ñ Hell is coming down, your fate has turned around ñ Too scared to make a sound ñ Now you're frozen there in your human shell ñ It's a nightmare I am the god of fear ñ Night ñ Nightmares ñ In the night
I filled a need in you ñ (I) expect a sense of truth and respect ñ You'll always chase what makes your heart flutter ñ I'll learn to live without your love ñ I'll learn to stand and breathe alone ñ I'll learn to walk on looking up ñ I'll learn to live without your love ñ Chase what makes your heart flutter ñ Sorting through lies just makes me sick ñ I am so glad I'm through with it ñ Chase what makes your heart flutter

I came away on that day drunk on you ñ May i conclude by the ways in your room ñ That were guilty and thus, are killers with our lust ñ And may i just say on this dog-eared day ñ That i found you alive and you passed it on inside ñ I came away on that day drunk on you ñ Will our demise be draped in disguise ñ To sniper us out, no signal, words without ñ But may i now say on this dog-eared day ñ That i found you alive and you colored me inside ñ You colored meaEUR|
Beloved! amid the earnest woes ñ That crowd around my earthly path- ñ (Drear path, alas! where grows ñ Not even one lonely rose)- ñ My soul at least a solace hath ñ In dreams of thee, and therein knows ñ An Eden of bland repose. ñ And thus thy memory is to me ñ Like some enchanted far-off isle ñ In some tumultuous sea- ñ Some ocean throbbing far and free ñ With storms- but where meanwhile ñ Serenest skies continually ñ Just o'er that one bright island smile.
Stuck in the middle of nowhere ñ Not knowing which way to turn ñ If I could only hold you now ñ And undo the bridges I burned ñ If I hadn't a left you standing there ñ To set my sail alone ñ Then maybe I'd be in your arms tonight ñ And I'd have more than your memory to hold ñ Well, I finally learned I'm lonesome ñ Now I know what it means to yearn ñ I found myself at the end of the line ñ I had no direction to turn

The medicine cabinet's empty, there's nothing for my head. Inside I'm made of concrete, my eyelids feel like lead. I'm feeling for pulse but it's no use.

I'll sing you a song and it's not very long ñ It's about a young man who never did wrong; ñ Suddenly he died one day ñ The reason why, no one would say ñ He was tall and long and his arms were strong ñ And this is the strange part of my song; ñ He was always well from foot to head ñ And then one day they found him dead ñ They found him dead so I've been told ñ His eyes were closed, his heart was cold; ñ Only one clue to why he died - ñ A bayonet sticking in his side

We hang our heads in the heavy house ñ With halls that scream a long slow no ñ Dirty thoughts fall from my soul ñ Heaped like clothes upon the floor ñ This night has a thousand lies ñ That burn holes in my petty head ñ Flesh creeps up all the wrong walls ñ It's my misfortune that you're suspicious ñ I could swear a thousand prayers and cast stone bibles into the sea ñ But my lifelines full of solitaire, yours is happy full of nothing
My first crush happened when I was 5 ñ So I gave him a glittered valentine ñ He laughed and proved why a crush is a crush ñ I cried all the way home on the bus ñ  ñ My first kiss happened at the top of the stairs ñ Near the lockers and the science layer ñ He pulled me in with such a rush ñ I'm going to miss my bus ñ  ñ My first love fell pretty flat ñ After some time I didn't want to deal with that ñ It became more of an obligation and a fuss ñ Like how I almost my bus

Missed you from the Hudson River ñ When the water whispered out your name ñ Feel my swollen bloody knuckles ñ Distance makes my feelings act the same ñ There's an aching in my stomach ñ Memories still turn me inside out ñ I want more than chocolate daydreams ñ Wanna taste your sweetness in my mouth ñ I don't know why I feel blue ñ Maybe I'm still into you ñ I don't know why I'm so blue ñ Maybe I'm not over you

A wave before it breaks? ñ Can you feel it? A calm before the storm? ñ Let's keep this passion flowing ñ Like a child I wait for love
They call me the greatest ñ 'Cause I'm not very good ñ And they're being sarcastic ñ They're being sarcastic ñ Oh, I'm taking names ñ But I'm not doing much ñ With the names that I'm taking ñ G-O-A-T ñ They're being sarcastic ñ They're being sarcastic ñ They call me the greatest ñ But those cheers can be quiet ñ So I listen close ñ I listen close ñ Yes I'm taking notes ñ But those notes aren't helping ñ The ink washes away ñ G-O-A-T ñ It washes away ñ It washes away

Summoning of the devil's army ñ We can't be sure ñ Something we've never seen before ñ Oh this I know ñ  ñ They won't waste time with you ñ They won't be able to ñ They won't waste time with you ñ They won't be able to ñ  ñ Calling on the heavens, amen ñ We're never sure ñ Something we've all seen before ñ Oh we don't know, oh, ohh ñ  ñ They won't waste time with you ñ They won't be able to ñ They won't waste time with you ñ They won't be able to ñ  ñ Oh, they won't be able to ñ No, they won't be able to
You're my water ñ You're my wine ñ You're my whiskey ñ From time to time ñ You're the hunger ñ On my bones ñ All the nights ñ I sleep alone ñ Sweet intoxication ñ When your words ñ Wash over me ñ Whether or not ñ Your lips move ñ You speak to me ñ Like an ocean ñ Without waves ñ You're the movement ñ That I crave ñ And in that motion ñ I long to drown ñ And be lost not to be found ñ You're my water ñ You're my wine ñ You're my whiskey ñ From time to time
You are so beautiful ñ To me ñ You are so beautiful ñ To me ñ Can't you see ñ  ñ You're everything I hoped for ñ You're everything I need ñ You are so beautiful to me ñ To me ñ  ñ Such joy and happiness you bring ñ Such joy and happiness you bring ñ Like a dream ñ A guiding light that shines in the night ñ Heavens gift to me ñ You are so beautiful to me ñ  ñ You are so beautiful ñ To me ñ Can't you see ñ You're everything I hoped for ñ Every, everything I need ñ You are so beautiful to me
Christmas, Christmas time is near ñ Time for toys and time for cheer ñ I've been good, but I can't last ñ Hurry Christmas, hurry fast ñ Want a plane that loops the loop ñ And I want a hula-hoop ñ I can hardly stand the wait ñ Please, Christmas, don't be late ñ  ñ Want a plane that loops the loop ñ And I still want a hula-hoop ñ I can hardly stand the wait ñ Please, Christmas, don't be late ñ I can hardly stand the wait ñ Please, Christmas, don't be late
*lyrics from snippet* ñ  ñ -love me when I sing ñ I love it when you start to scream ñ  ñ I love it when you need me ñ Like you're favourite CD ñ I would let you kill me ñ I can be your Nancy ñ Loving you is easy ñ Driving in the backseat ñ I keep thinking maybe ñ Maybe it's the way I- ñ The way I like you ñ The way I like you ñ The way I like you ñ The way I like you ñ  ñ I pray-
A crossroad ñ With no direction ñ Destination zero ñ I am nowhere to be found ñ  ñ Save me ñ Save me ñ  ñ Borderline ahead ñ This is the edge of my world ñ Burdensome was my cross ñ To bear this far ñ  ñ Save me ñ Save me ñ  ñ What have I become ñ An exiled ñ Unbearable ñ My self caused affliction ñ  ñ Save me ñ Save me ñ  ñ What have I become ñ An exiled ñ Unbearable ñ My self caused affliction

Starving your envy ñ Feeding off faith ñ Well I am cold tonight ñ I am afraid ñ We're all scared of something ñ Just don't run from me ñ I'll follow you always ñ Until you give in
We close our eyes ñ Wait for the night to come ñ It just takes time ñ This boy is why ñ We've come from far away ñ But who saves whose life? ñ Day after day ñ Skin burned in deadly heat ñ A fractional prize ñ Night after night ñ It becomes clear to me ñ That I'm wasting time ñ We've tried and we're tired ñ But there's still much to be done ñ Let's not lose sight ñ 3 AM comes ñ He calls them to their knees ñ And I pray we're right
What makes the world go round, and why am I so upside down ñ I'm back in a tidal wave ñ I'm falling in love with a tidal wave ñ I'm lost in a tidal wave ñ I'm stuck in a tidal wave ñ Fucked in a tidal wave ñ As far as I can see in a tidal wave ñ Down in a tidal wave ñ Upside down in a tidal wave ñ Drowned in a tidal wave ñ Icy fingers running up and down my cock ñ Sharks like to bite you, you know it's true ñ Water on the bran, its all the same ñ Help help help it's coming your way ñ Swim swim swim like a tuna fish
You're not even worth the finger I gave you ñ Step aside 'cause it's too late to undo ñ Thanks a lot for all the pain and hurt ñ Happy endings don't mix with the real world ñ Can't kill me, Fire within ñ Overkill, stonedead ñ I will make you pay ñ Grinding, smashing ñ I will drive you insane ñ I just wonder how you can be so goddamn naive ñ You're being stupid beyond belief ñ Do not talk to me about the misery ñ You ain't seen nothing yet, got more to give
Stay ñ Stay for our time is now ñ Be what you want to be ñ Love ñ Love like a ladybird ñ Never leave ñ Leave me ñ Summertime ladybird ñ Blood red black ñ Let the wheels turn ñ Fire overhead burns ñ Baby cries ñ And mummy wonders why ñ Daddy says 'They must die' ñ Let me be ñ What I want to be ñ Ladybird, fly free ñ Stay ñ Stay for our time is now ñ Be what you want to be ñ Love ñ Love like a ladybird ñ Never leave ñ Leave me
Have your baggage and your passports ready and follow the green line to customs and then to immigration. BA 215 to Rome, Cairo and Lagos ñ  ñ Live for today, gone tomorrow. That's me ñ *Laughs*
I'm lost in your corridors ñ I've been round every corner ñ I've opened every door ñ Winding round in circles ñ Like a rat or a minotaur ñ Ooh, live my life in your beautiful maze ñ Ooh, mysterio ñ How can I resist ñ Those footsteps in the mist? ñ I want to disappear with you ñ Where she's from ñ No one really knows ñ She came in on a seashell ñ Not wearing any clothes ñ The lovers lined up for her ñ Went down like dominoes ñ Ooh, live my life in your beautiful maze ñ Ooh, mysterio
Born from boredom into poison the stupid shit that we do these days. Well I can't lie; I'm just as guilty. I wear it all on my fucking face. So who am I to say anything? So who am I to place blame? The guilt could eat a man alive but I ain't got any shame. I've got my problems I've got my vices but I'm learning to live with my mistakes. I just take it all with a grain of salt. That taste just doesn't go away
There is a town ñ Where I was born ñ Far far away ñ Across the sea ñ And in that town ñ Where I was born ñ I would dream ñ That one day ñ I would leave ñ And cross the sea ñ  ñ And so it goes ñ And so it seems ñ That God lives only in our dreams ñ In our dreams ñ  ñ And now I live ñ In this town ñ I walk these dark streets ñ Up and down, up and down ñ Under a dark sky ñ And I dream ñ That one day ñ I'll go back home ñ  ñ And so it goes ñ And so it seems ñ That God lives only in our dreams ñ In our dreams
Running out of time (2x) ñ How to make you see ñ Playing on my mind (2x) ñ Come get lost with me ñ I can make you mine (2x) ñ But you won't let me ñ But we're running out of time, running out of time ñ And you won't let me ñ (2x) ñ Running out of time(2x) ñ Playing on my mind(2x) ñ Running out of time(2x) ñ I can make you mine(2x) ñ Chorus (2x): ñ Am i losing you (2x) ñ It's the last thing I wanted to do ñ Am i losing you ñ 'Cause it's the last thing I wanted to do
Full-grown and road-worn ñ Find the key to backtalk ñ Assume the shortcuts ñ Prepare for the worst luck ñ No shortcuts ñ No cheat books ñ Replacements for closed doors
If you have love in your heart ñ Then who am I to judge you? ñ If you have love in your heart ñ Then no one will rise above you ñ I'm a complicated man ñ I only wish that that were true ñ If you have love in your heart ñ Then no one will rise above you ñ In the New Jack City ñ In the New Jack City
I see the underdog dream slipping away ñ I see a funeral march for the ordinary ñ Martyred dead fading from an epoch ñ An epitaph like an old folk song ñ We're bleeding out ñ The inquest it goes on ñ The cause of death unknown ñ We're bleeding out ñ They cut so deep ñ Someone better raise the dead ñ Frozen in formaldehyde ñ Endless inconclusive tests ñ Someone better raise the dead
Oh Suzie Q., oh Suzie Q ñ Oh Suzie Q., baby I love you ñ Suzie Q ñ I like the way you walk ñ I like the way you talk ñ I like the way you walk, I like the way you talk ñ My Suzie Q ñ Oh Suzie Q., oh Suzie Q ñ Oh Suzie Q., baby I love you ñ My Suzie Q ñ Well say that you will be true ñ Say that you will be true ñ Say that you will be true and never leave me blue ñ My Suzie Q ñ Oh Suzie Q., oh Suzie Q ñ Oh Suzie Q., baby I love you ñ My Suzie Q
Amid the glimpse ñ The bleary binocular truth ñ Mirthless amusement ñ Hollow sympathy ñ Certainly uncertain ñ Futile perceptions ñ Of avuncular concern ñ Remotely on the point ñ Wasted aphorism ñ Forsaken quest ñ Knowingly unknowing ñ Stained spotlessness presumed ñ Unheeded minions ñ Maul the stairs
Rain was your birth ñ Gathered deep ñ Beneath the earth ñ Search and seep ñ Hollow stone ñ Issue and flow ñ Virgin stream ñ Meander free ñ It's a long way to the sea ñ Caves and canyons ñ Stark prison walls ñ Swirl and hurl you
I don't seem to care about ñ Going' to school ñ The golden rule ñ Reading a book ñ The president's a crook ñ Moral values ñ A nightly news ñ Gettin' a job ñ That i'm a beer drinking slob ñ Some people call me apathetic ñ (but at least i don't read dianetics) ñ I don't seem to care about ñ Hypocrites ñ Politics ñ Hippy chicks ñ Porno flicks
I wasn't missing it ñ I wasn't listening ñ I turned away ñ When I heard them say ñ It's Dial-A-Song ñ I always had my doubts ñ So I just tuned it out ñ I didn't know ñ Why they had to crow ñ About Dial-A-Song ñ My mind is a desert ñ And it's the horizon line ñ My soul was destroyed ñ Now it fills the void ñ The songs on that telephone line ñ I could be guessing wrong ñ But I'm still hanging on ñ I'm still on the ropes ñ Stuck on my hopes ñ For Dial-A-Song
And I don't think I've got this in me ñ And I don't feel the way you do ñ It's been a while now and it kills me to say that ñ It's just too much ñ And I ñ  ñ I think I've had enough ñ I think I've had enough ñ  ñ And I feel like I haven't slept in months ñ And it takes everything I have to get up ñ It has for a while now, it kills me to say it ñ It just too much ñ And I ñ  ñ I think I've had enough ñ I think I've had enough ñ  ñ Please, take me home ñ Please, take me home ñ  ñ I think I've had enough ñ I think I've had enough
You opened your foodgate and closed down the store ñ And spread your disease like an unrubbered whore ñ Doomed from the start - tear your goals apart ñ You're so fucking lost, there's nothing to say ñ Maybe we don't suit you but we won't go away ñ (Keep your hand on your gun, don't trust anyone) ñ Make a move and you'll see what the fuck you mean to be
You, you better get ready ñ You better hold steady ñ They can't control this angry mob ñ They'll have to call the Riot Squad ñ Riot Squad ñ They'll have to call the Riot Squad ñ They'll have to call the Riot Squad ñ They'll have to call the Riot Squad
I don't want you I don't need you ñ I wanna know... ñ I wanna know how it'd feel ñ Without a single confrontation ñ I don't want you I don't need you ñ I wanna know... ñ I wanna know how it'd feel ñ Without a single confrontation ñ I say, you're good ñ Guide you, got you by ñ Maybe, way out wish you ñ Why could we be to be all? ñ I don't want you I don't need you ñ I wanna know how you feel in a confrontation
Will I ever find the girl on my mind, the one who is my ideal ñ Maybe she's a dream, and yet she might be ñ Just around the corner waiting for me ñ Will I recognize the light in her eyes, that no other eyes reveal ñ Or will I pass her by and never even know that she is my ideal
I've turned down all devotion ñ I'm so far from being here ñ Can't bring forth more power ñ Than I have already done ñ Tonight I'm trying ñ And I see all dread in me ñ But then I lose again ñ All hope of being someone ñ This lack of devotion ñ Will put me to an end ñ So if you want to save me ñ And stop me when I run ñ Just tell me that i'll have now ñ A day less to live when I'm done

When you return ñ I'll be around to welcome you ñ And then you'll learn ñ How much I missed you, dear ñ Oh yes, you'll learn ñ That though you were away from me ñ My heart had kept you locked inside ñ And you were near ñ When you return ñ I'll never ever let you go ñ Our flame will burn ñ As though you'd never gone ñ So come back soon ñ I'll wait to hold you close once more ñ I'll wait for you to say I do ñ When you return
I "checked up on it" ñ She said, "Don't blow me off" ñ But I did ñ Eating Star Crunch and Zebra Cakes ñ And washing it down with Colt 45 ñ Cheddar dogs, Big Macs ñ Cheesesteaks and Chicken Fries

I've been beaten down, I've been kicked around ñ But she takes it all for me ñ And I lost my faith, in my darkest days ñ But she makes me want to believe ñ They call her love, love, love, love, love. (x2) ñ She is love, and she is all I need ñ She's all I need ñ Well I had my ways, they were all in vain ñ And she waited patiently ñ It was all the same, all my pride and shame ñ And she put me on my feet ñ They call her love, love, love, love, love. (x3) ñ She is love, and she is all I need. (x3) ñ --- ñ .
Cease to resist, giving my goodbye ñ Drive my car into the ocean ñ You'll think I'm dead, but I sail away ñ On a wave of mutilation ñ Wave of mutilation ñ Wave of mutilation ñ Wave, wave ñ I've kissed mermaids, rode the El Nino ñ Walked the sand with the crustaceans ñ Could find my way to Mariana ñ On a wave of mutilation ñ Wave of mutilation ñ Wave of mutilation ñ Wave, wave ñ Wave of mutilation ñ Wave of mutilation ñ Wave of mutilation ñ Wave, wave
You've got a number so fuck your name ñ Spoke in the wheel, pawn in the game ñ You're dying by design ñ You're living by their lies ñ Food for worms trapped in a flag ñ To hell and back in a bodybag ñ The stench of lies, it fills the air ñ Traded all hope for despair ñ No one ever told you ñ No one ever cared ñ When it all came down ñ There was no one there
We have been stuck ñ Inside the same space ñ Yet all that we share ñ Is this cold war ñ And there has got to be ñ A better way ñ To see ñ To see eye to eye ñ When we're not face to face ñ Trade our hostility ñ In for humanity ñ And maybe ñ Maybe we can say ñ Lay down ñ Lay down ñ Lay down your arms ñ Lay down ñ Lay down ñ Lay down your love ñ Repeat all ñ Oh, I can tell ñ By the look in your eyes ñ You'll be the one ñ Who will sympathize ñ Repeat chorus
May our right hand bring us closer to our Godliness ñ May our left hand give us strength to face each day ñ And before us may our vision light our paths ahead ñ And behind us may well-being heal our way ñ Al around us is Shechinah (4x) ñ Miy'mini Michaeil, umismoli Gavriel ñ Umil'fanai Uri'eil, umei'achorai R'faeil ñ V'al roshi Sh'china (4x) ñ May Micheal be at my right hand, Gabriel at my left ñ Before me Uriel, behind me Raphael ñ And above my head the Divine Presence ñ Jared Harrison Saks

Living in the past ñ Is not living at all ñ The old fear going fast ñ Everybody's scared to fall ñ Turn with the times ñ Change your mind ñ Sullen and profane ñ The ancient temple stands ñ Dissolving in the rain ñ Its gods long turned to sand ñ Forgotten childhood rhyme ñ Change your mind ñ Listen for the ring ñ Of tomorrow's bell ñ Be the first to sing ñ From beyond the wishing well ñ Know what's behind ñ But change your mind
My love must be a kind of blind love ñ I can't see anyone but you ñ Sha bop sha bop ñ Are the stars out tonight ñ I don't know if it's cloudy or bright ñ I only have eyes for you dear ñ The moon may be high ñ But I can't see a thing in the sky ñ I only have eyes for you ñ I don't know if we're in a garden ñ Or on a crowded avenue ñ You are here and so am I ñ Maybe millions of people go by ñ But they all dissappear from view ñ And I only have eyes for you

FZ: Thank you. And now, for a little piece of teen-age ecstasy that'll give Patrick, our bass player, a chance to show off, this is a song that we did on the Saturday Night Show, which uh--in the section where Belushi came out and was the Samurai saxophone player--unfortunately we don't have a Samurai saxophone player tonight so you'll have to use your imagination. We have an insert in that area, with a little bit of S&M allusion. The name of this tune is "The Purple Lagoon."

I'd have to be blind - to be safe ñ I'd need to be deaf - to be safe ñ I would need to be wounded in all my senses ñ But then i wouldn't be human ñ Wouldn't be able to tell ñ About what is going on in my heart!!! ñ I'd have to be stupid not to see the enemy ñ I'd have to be an idiot to ignore him ñ I'd have to be out of my life ñ But then i wouldn't be human ñ Wouldn't be able to tell ñ About what is going on in my heart!!! ñ So what's happening in my heart of a pacifist?!

He learned to identify with the fleas in the doorkeeper's collar ñ He learned all their names, he learned what each could do ñ He appealed to their sense of vanity with kindly words and gifts ñ And sometimes thoughts of love, and sometimes he thought it helped ñ But none of it really helped, none of his gifts or words changed a thing ñ They always saw right through him
I'm a working on building ñ For my lord for my lord ñ It's a holy ghost building ñ For my lord for my lord ñ  ñ If I was a liar I tell you what I would do ñ I would quit my lying and work on a building too ñ  ñ  ñ If I was drunkard I tell you what I would do ñ I would quit my drinking and work on a building too ñ I'm a working on building ñ  ñ  ñ If I was a preacher I tell you what I would do ñ I would keep on preaching and work on a building too ñ I'm a working on building
We embrace pain ñ The value of suffering ñ The hooks sting, removing skin ñ The punishment of self ñ A task we learn to do so well ñ Pleasure leads to hell! ñ We are the Flagellants ñ Your faithful servants ñ Persecutors and martyrs ñ Victims of faith ñ "Salve Kyrie" ñ Your faithful servants are insane ñ "Salve Kyrie" ñ Sinners or Saints? ñ It's Dogma ñ "Salve Kyrie" ñ Your faithful servants are insane ñ It's Dogma ñ "Salve Kyrie" ñ Your faithful servants are insane ñ It's Dogma ñ "Salve" ñ Sinners or Saints? ñ Dogma

Mom and dad parted ways ñ We were young and got good grades and ñ Trees in yards meant to climb ñ We left home and never looked behind ñ To feel alone ñ We feel alone ñ You and I parted ways ñ I don't think I'll ever see your face ñ We latch on to a heart ñ Meant to hold but we get torn apart ñ To feel alone ñ We feel alone
We all hope to signal kin ñ The rays of gold now rain on tin ñ Gather 'round, gather friends ñ Never fear, never again
Miriam and Florian ñ When no one's around ñ Long black curls ñ And small white pearls ñ Together found ñ Lovers drowned ñ Miriam loved Florian ñ And his white horse ñ She thinks of them ñ Especially when the line of force ñ Takes it's course ñ Florian loved Miriam ñ Her reddish brown ñ He thinks of her smelling myrrh and ñ Her reddish brown ñ When he went down
You used to be such a close friend ñ We had such good time back then ñ Now we've lost touch over the years ñ But I still remember those days and all the beer ñ Chorus ñ 2x I still remember - all the good times ñ We've gone our own ways and drifted apart ñ If I saw you today I wouldn't know where to start ñ It's funny how things turn out it the end ñ But I still remember you, my friend

Where did we fall? ñ How did it hit so hard? ñ Was holding your hand ñ Glass turned to sand ñ You said it was sky ñ So where did we fall? ñ Where did we fall? ñ I still hear the crash ñ Your heart against my wall
I saw a reflection of a shadow ñ Of a woman I once loved ñ There stood my faith, my own ñ Reflection, bitterness more often than love ñ So I bought a gun, took a pill, hung a rope ñ To reach my love ñ But I had no bullets, just and aspiring, bitterness ñ More often than love
Lyrics from Snippet ñ  ñ Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah ñ  ñ Shit, I was thinking, I've been drinking too much ñ Overthinking, doing everything I ñ Said I wouldn't do now I do it because of you ñ Said I wouldn't do but it's hard when it's in front of you ñ Oh now, I'm in my head again ñ I'm thinking 'bout what I could've said, and done ñ But now, it's said and done ñ And I realized I need your love ñ It's getting late and now I realize, yeah...
Just last week ñ I could not believe ñ What I would see ñ The tears rolled down softly ñ Nudged down the stairs ñ Oh, so sadly ñ We could steal ñ The truth to never be seen ñ One stair, two stairs ñ Three stairs, go spiraling ñ At best a cracked head ñ Will stop your smiling ñ With playful blood streams ñ Talking and smirking ñ At the bottom ñ Of a stairwell, I saw you ñ I swear ñ  ñ One stair, two stairs ñ Three stairs, go spiraling ñ Waiting ñ I'm waiting
Taker, you faker. Motherfucker, who the fuck are you? Taker, you faker...Motherfucker, father of two.  You wake alone your left side's lighter. Your chest is tighter in a bed all of half made.

Taker, you faker...Motherfucker, father of two. Taker, you faker..Motherfucker. You'll be born before you through. Wake up
Mother, you had me but I never had you ñ I wanted you but you didn't want me ñ So I got to tell you ñ Goodbye, goodbye ñ  ñ Father, you left me but I never left you ñ I needed you but you didn't need me ñ So I got to tell you ñ Goodbye, goodbye ñ  ñ Children, don't do what I have done ñ I couldn't walk but I tried to run ñ So I got to tell you ñ Goodbye, goodbye ñ  ñ Mama don't go ñ Daddy come home 
Deepest oceans of despair ñ This vast and somber ñ Charcoal night of space ñ Have you given up yet? ñ What hope lingers in the crevasses and corners of your soul? ñ I know you ñ You haven't given up yet ñ You are brave in this darkness, Saint Saturn ñ Sometimes the bravest thing of all is to hope
Up all night ñ Something's right ñ You and I ñ Forget about the time ñ The streets tonight ñ Speak and sigh ñ You and I ñ Under LA lights ñ Up all night ñ Underneath the lights ñ Up all night ñ Under LA lights ñ Up all night ñ Something's right ñ Between you and I ñ Up all night ñ Something's right ñ With your eyes
I think I love you better now ñ Don't hold me down ñ I think the braces are breaking ñ And it's more than I can take
In your eyes, I see the fire ñ Of the burning heart, of a loving soul ñ In my eyes you see the moon ñ Reflected by the sea ñ That's how love can be ñ Truly living deep inside me ñ Deep inside my heart ñ Love will never die ñ Truly living deep inside me ñ Come forgive me ñ Love will never die ñ Together we walk hand in hand ñ Through the darkest night ñ I see the light...
Silently, I wait the tears to fall ñ Forlorn entity, none to all ñ Vale of anguish, fragrant solitude ñ Bathed in sadness, sorrows interlude ñ There is no black, no white, no grey ñ There is no light, no dark, no dussk ñ Only subtle shades of pastels ñ A distant choir, a subtle melody ñ Fading perfume, haunting memory ñ Like stars fell in the snow ñ Eternal fires no longer glow ñ There is no black... ñ Only subtle shades of pastels ñ Silently, I wait the tears to fall
Oh traveller of the Moon, if you see my girl tell her to come back soon ñ She's a red-headed queen, she ain't very mean, oh traveller of the Moon ñ Oh traveller of the Sun, have you seen my head on the run? ñ It's a big old balloon, ain't come back too soon, oh traveller of the Sun ñ Oh, father, father, time, please don't cry, please don't cry ñ Your daughter, she's just fine, in your mind and in my mind ñ Your daughter she's just fine
I have traveled so far to find so little ñ Meaning in tragedy or tragedy ñ In the search for meaning ñ Dark clouds have lead me here ñ Confined freedom ñ Guides us to security ñ What if everything (yeah) ñ I have been taught is a lie ñ And all of my teachers ñ Have been wrong this whole time ñ Compelling us to fight ñ The battles they would not ñ They have already won ñ And we have already lost ñ If we do not learn from their mistakes ñ We have already lost ñ We have already lost ñ If we do not learn to change

Faith can turn an angry sea ñ Into a gentle stream ñ Faith can turn a stormy cloud ñ Into a pled sun bean ñ Faith can turn a teardrop ñ Into a shining star ñ Faith is what I have in you ñ No matter where you are ñ Faith can take a broken heart ñ And make it laugh and sing ñ Faith can take a lonely fool ñ And make him think he's king ñ So please have faith my darlin' ñ And share that faith with me ñ And we'll have love, sacred love ñ Faithful love eternally
Blowing the ashes ñ Of the burning father ñ As the stream dies ñ Kiss your own finger ñ Whites of the eye ñ Looking where ñ The sun spots shine ñ There is nothing ñ That's all there is ñ Nothing held back
Sometimes I sit and I wonder, why, things turned out this way ñ All the times she made me happy, but I couldn't make her stay ñ Now I need some lovin' - don't want to spend my life alone ñ Yea, yea I need somebody ñ It's so sad to be alone - it's so sad to be alone
She Mourns A Lengthening Shadow" ñ 1996 Cacophonus Records ñ Hasten to the bridal bed - ñ Underneath the grave 'tis spread: ñ In darkness may our love be hid ñ Oblivion be our coverlid - ñ We may rest, and nione forbid
I can't forget all I've said ñ And I know its not too late ñ To remind you of our days ñ And the things that you have said ñ But you just cover up your ears ñ Building walls within your fears ñ I can't help it I'm going down ñ But I'm still waiting for you somehow ñ Over the trees I still dream ñ Of your smiles on the screen ñ I have nothing of you with me ñ No voice no picture just a memory ñ I didn't see you behind the hills ñ And I don't think I ever will ñ Go with my love over the hills ñ Far below I'm waiting still

On a tropical island ñ Underneath the molten lava moon ñ Hanging with the hula dancers ñ Asking questions 'cause they got all the answers ñ Putting on lotion ñ Sitting by the ocean ñ Rubbing it on my body ñ Rubbing it on my body ñ Get me out of this cave ñ Cause it's nothing but a gladiator grave ñ And if I stick to the plan ñ I think I'll turn into a lava man ñ I think I'll turn into a lava man!
This is tearing me apart ñ I don't know what I feel now ñ My head is caving in ñ My body's getting tired ñ The sound of selfishness ñ Is killing me right now ñ When will this end? When will this stop? ñ Run away but it's no use ñ This is wrong oh, so wrong ñ I'll drown myself and never wake up ñ I'll die alone ñ I want to reach out ñ But it's me that's keeping me ñ From helping myself ñ I know its lame and that's a shame ñ Please don't do this ñ I can't take it anymore ñ Just as I was forgetting you
Throw off your golden light ñ And shed it all around ñ Burn as the moon at midnight ñ Rise and fall straight down ñ Mortal ground ñ Don't turn your back against the wind ñ She's psycho crazy, but she draws you in ñ Close your eyes and free fall ñ Rise and fall straight down ñ Mortal ground ñ See how it turns and twists and breaks ñ This fate
When in doubt you ñ Must repeat this ñ Elemental ñ Post-script refrain ñ Where I love you ñ Doesn't matter ñ It's the what ñ That loves who we are

I cannot be contained in a culture ñ You are consumed by outward appearance ñ They're self-absorbed ñ You're beautiful ñ Stand at arms length so insecure ñ It's not the right time of year ñ I look on the heart ñ I cannot be contained in appearance ñ It's not the right time of year to be cool

I'm slipping into grey ñ And I was (in my way) good to you ñ And you were good for me ñ Bye bye my love ñ Going to play the end game ñ It's growing kind of still ñ You know there always will be a dream ñ Waiting for you when ñ Sleep comes around ñ I had to play the end game ñ Bless us all. I must say ñ It was good, you know ñ Keep me in mind for ñ A re-match in warm snow ñ The faces at the door ñ Couldn't have looked more lost to see ñ Me waving as I brush ñ Away a tear ñ Gone to play the end game
Well, you should see Polythene Pam ñ She's so good-looking but she looks like a man ñ Well, you should see her in drag dressed in her polythene bag ñ Yes, you should see Polythene Pam ñ Yeah, yeah, yeah ñ Get a dose of her in jackboots and kilt ñ She's killer-diller when she's dressed to the hilt ñ She's the kind of a girl that makes the "News of the World" ñ Yes, you could say she was attractively built ñ Yeah, yeah, yeah

Got to know just ñ What I'm doing with my life
Where did your long hair go ñ Where is the girl I used to know ñ How could you lose that happy glow ñ Oh, Caroline no ñ Who took that look away ñ I remember how you used to say ñ You'd never change, but that's not true ñ Oh, Caroline you ñ Break my heart ñ I want to go and cry ñ It's so sad to watch a sweet thing die ñ Oh, Caroline why ñ Could I ever find in you again ñ Things that made me love you so much then ñ Could we ever bring 'em back once they have gone ñ Oh, Caroline no
And 6 am in morningside ñ The first car rushes by ñ We walk down to the garden ñ And the sunlight fills your eyes ñ And stops me for a moment ñ Till i turn and look the other way ñ The windows are all open ñ And it's saturday ñ And where i ride the evening turns to blue ñ And fades away ñ A silence hangs enchanted ñ Through sunset and the lane ñ The air is charged with sunlight ñ And your name is ringing through my mind ñ Cathedral bells and sunlit is the night
You keep on trying too hard to make something work out ñ You're so afraid of your own loneliness and doubts ñ I've had to stand by so many times while you got burned ñ And I hope someday you'll finally learn ñ That I will always be there ñ I will always be there  ñ This isolation oppresses, it's bringing you down ñ And you're still smashing and crashing your head against walls ñ And if you're not really happy, well, no one is ñ But I just hope you remember this ñ That I will always be there ñ I will always be there

This was no upbringing. It only tore me down ñ I was not taught. I was twisted ñ This education is deprivation of the truth, halting my growth ñ Governed in the wrong ñ Schooled in churches of dissent ñ A fear of everything instilled in me ñ But bleeding through this involvement, I dub myself ñ I unlearned what you have beat into me ñ Governed in the wrong ñ Schooled in churches of dissent ñ A fear of every man instilled in me ñ Driven in like nails

Happy the man, and happy he alone ñ He who can call today his own: ñ He who, secure within, can say ñ Tomorrow do thy worst, for I have lived today

What is this thing that makes the birdies sing ñ The flowers bloom out of season? ñ Sweetheart, I know the answer: ñ Love is the reason! ñ Why did the clouds of gray just roll away ñ The very moment I found you? ñ Why do I hang around you? ñ Love is the reason! ñ You came with the rainbow ñ Right after the rain ñ You brought me the sunshine ñ Now I'm walking in clover all over again! ñ It is a thrill divine or just as fine ñ That comes from heaven above you; ñ Why do I say I love you? ñ Love is the reason!

I gave up everything ñ Even though I was a king ñ I sat under the crown ñ I'm waiting for the light ñ I won't be leaving soon ñ 'Cause life is just waiting ñ But I know for what ñ It's good to know ñ That it's only diception ñ I'll wait 40 days or 9 lives ñ It really doesn't matter ñ What counts is here and now ñ Not surfing in California ñ Light is worth 100 prayers ñ Demons stealing peace are merciless ñ They are strong but can be beat ñ By 2 small girls: Love and humility ñ Bright so light!!!

Started listening to lots of different people and I found that ñ None of us know what we're doing (*laughter*) ñ Not one of us know what we're doing ñ (*laughter* That's so honest, I love that) ñ I feel like humanity is collectively waking up ñ And we're kinda going "Wait we're here; what does this mean?

Walking in a dream ñ Far from any meaning ñ You're astonished I forgot your name ñ Trying to get things back ñ From my memory bank ñ Nothing helps me ñ Make a mental chain ñ Hey ñ Do I know you? ñ Hey ñ Do I want to? ñ You might be sweet ñ Or lying through your teeth ñ It's kind of freaky you know me so well ñ The time has come for me to excuse myself ñ You must have mistaken me for someone else ñ Next time we meet I may remember ñ You never can tell ñ Hey ñ Do I know you? ñ Hey ñ Do I want to?
When I was climbing up the walls it used to be a blast ñ And I would say something dumb only to get a laugh ñ But now lips are looser and brain doesn't think as fast ñ And all these chemicals just make the time pass ñ My fear of going it alone is what it all comes down to ñ And all of my crutches are breaking my bones ñ And all of my helpers just help me sink like a stone ñ And I'm expecting a chorus of sighs and groans ñ And all of my crutches are breaking my bones ñ Can I stand on my own?

Wire in the teeth ñ While we warm twine ñ While we breathe ñ Skip notes and bless ñ Where you been ñ We lose days ñ Broke hearts are whole ñ Or burned by the christians ñ Recline held under your tongue ñ Like a tiny stone carried home ñ Sung throated air ñ Down your spine ñ Crown cooks light ñ We wolfed and whale bellied on ñ We shone down ñ Blinder and winterless days ñ Lost a black ocean recline ñ Held under your tongue ñ Like a tiny stone ñ Paid and gone

I have died from within ñ The beginning of an end ñ But I still stand ñ Seeing red ñ The anger made me strong ñ The vision was mine ñ Horizon becomes vast ñ Claim your throne ñ The fire turns to flames ñ I had it all ñ Before the fall ñ Warlords of misanthropy ñ Powers ñ Spiritual powers to foresee ñ Warlords of misanthropy ñ Warriors of the fall ñ Through sinful years ñ The hellish burden ñ That I was given
The Carter is the place ñ And i'm running this thing like im walking in the race like they walking in place ñ Then I walk in that place like give me my cake ñ And yeah I'm a martian so give me my space ñ Me timmet, me timmet never date oops i mean never dat only uhhh after that have her back ñ I send you back to the womb you climbed out of ñ I milks this thing, now boy get your cows up ñ Shorty give me brain like she smart as brittany houser ñ And I stay connected like an internet browser
Oh no it's the bats ñ Oh no ñ Run ñ Haha ñ Run get to the choppa
I always knew you never cared about me ñ But I am waiting for you to hold my hand ñ Your hug is troubling my thoughts ñ Tell me, did you ever love me? ñ  ñ Did you ever love me? ñ Did you ever love me? ñ  ñ I always knew you never cared about me ñ But I can't fix the pain in my heart ñ Your smell is nostalgic, deep in my heart ñ Tell me, did you ever love me? ñ  ñ Did you ever love me? ñ Did you ever love me? ñ  ñ Did you ever love me? ñ Did you ever love me?

Instrumental introduction
Sometimes I can't help but feel the stars are laughing at me ñ I must have made that f*cking wish every night for the past year ñ There's a place on the way up to princess park ñ That I'd like to go but I can't go alone ñ Someimes I can't help but feel that time has left without me ñ I though that when you saved someone's life they'd be around forever ñ I just want you to know that I'm still around ñ And even if you hate me I'm still glad I got to know you
Once spoken ñ Words perfume the air ñ Like woodsmoke, like a breath of self that's no longer there ñ Such confidence ñ Such half-baked truth... ñ The sound of distant voices mocks the hubris of youth
Nine words in, ink on skin ñ Justification of the choice you made then ñ Nine words on, pages torn ñ Clarification of the choice you made then ñ Come on you know your heart's still beating ñ Always when you're feeling ñ Strung out recalling eyes first meeting ñ Always when you're dreaming. //Come on you know your heart's still beating ñ Always when you're feeling ñ Strung out recalling eyes first meeting ñ Always when you're dreaming
And I don't even know how I survive ñ I won't make it to the shore without your light ñ No I don't even know if I'm alive ñ Oh, oh, oh, without you now ñ This is what it feels like ñ  ñ This is what it feels li-- ñ  ñ And I don't even know how I survive ñ I won't make it to the shore without your light ñ No I don't even know if I'm alive ñ Oh, oh, oh, without you now ñ This is what it feels like ñ Feels like, feels like, feels like, feels like... ñ  ñ This is what it feels li--
Reading between the lines I find ñ You don't mean what you say ñ You cheated and you lied ñ And how you made me hurt inside ñ You turn my days into darkest nights ñ And rearranged my dreams ñ You're just not what you seem ñ Black-hearted lady ñ I am from the land ñ So you won't understand my grief ñ I lived in vain belief ñ In a world of poisoned words ñ And everywhere I look ñ I find no answer to my prayer ñ You're just not there ñ Black-hearted lady
"Your Super Shotgun is nearby, a relic from your past. The priests have kept it hidden from you in this remote location."
Life is what you make it ñ That's what the people say ñ And if I can't make it through tomorrow ñ I'd better make it through today ñ  ñ I have had my share of troubles ñ It's nothing new to me ñ When I look around me ñ All I see is misery
Right here, right now
Drawn into the maelstrom ñ Brothers three lost at sea ñ A cyclone of mayhem ñ Spiraling to the deep ñ The waters of bedlam ñ Scream to thee deafening ñ Hopeless situation ñ Puppets on a string ñ Inside of the maelstrom ñ Waves like ice, black as night ñ A whirlpool of chaos ñ Triton's eye opens wide ñ Descent into madness ñ Most have died, one survived ñ From out of the abyss ñ I escaped alive
Fierce and dense ñ Religious offense ñ Darkness howls ñ Viscera and bowels ñ Corpses as thicket ñ Internals exhibit ñ Vultures feast ñ Ruptured priest
Black misery ñ Conflict and negotiations ñ Nothing left to feed my family ñ Black misery ñ Pestilence and harvests lost ñ Monarchs never count the cost ñ Hostages to higher lifestyles ñ Humans cannot live this way ñ No choice for the third estate ñ No choice for the meek ñ With conspiracies you raise yourselves to trample us to dust ñ No future for the weak ñ To watch while you avail yourselves of what belongs to us ñ Of what belongs to us
I love it when it rains ñ And I lie in bed at night ñ I listen to it patter ñ On the roof soft and light ñ But then a storm may come ñ And the thunder starts to crash ñ The rain beats on the window ñ And I see the lightening flash ñ I hold old teddy tight ñ And sink down in my bed ñ I close my eyes so tight ñ And pull the covers over my head ñ I feel so safe and warm ñ I know that everything's all right ñ I love it when it rains ñ As I lie in bed at night
Good night moon ñ You've followed me ñ You're my guiding light ñ Through this mellow night ñ Happiness is out of sight ñ Good night moon ñ Good night moon ñ You keep me safe ñ And you remind me of ñ No matter how tough ñ I'm still strong enough ñ Good night moon ñ You wear me out ñ And I'm felling used ñ Tired and confused ñ I am not amused ñ Good night world ñ Good night moon!
Hollow point ñ The damage is done ñ We didn't know that this would all be gone ñ Casa mia is dust ñ Our friendship is dust ñ Bougainvillaea weeping over plces we've lived ñ Turn into somebody else ñ The free fall is taken for granted ñ It's OK to lie back and let it all pass ñ Because if you don't your body will crack ñ And you'll let the heart go
We seek the Son of God ñ We seek the Risen Lord ñ We seek the King of kings ñ The Savior of the world ñ We give our lives to You ñ We choose to follow You ñ We believe in You ñ We worship You ñ We seek Your face and ñ Humble ourselves here ñ The fire of God ñ Consuming the hearts of man ñ Nations will bow to You ñ Kingdoms will shake before ñ You ñ We pray for revival ñ We pray for revival
Don't be a fool, don't be an army-tool ñ You'll be army-bait, a puppet of the state ñ Without a purpose, without goals ñ You'll be used to slaughter innocent souls ñ Bait of the state-so, what we're trying to say ñ Bait of the state-don't throw your lifes away ñ Bait of the state-by bringing death and senseless pain ñ Bait of the state-there ain't nothing to f**king gain
The nosebleed sun bled on me ñ Shedding me but letting me through ñ A common ground with a nothing around ñ Would help me forget what I knew ñ A belly of warmth that lives on the sand ñ Like cold shadows live on the land ñ A sign that life in a shapes and size ñ Aren't equal to that of a man ñ Death to my left and my ego far behind ñ I cherish the gift that is life ñ As I search for a sign a gate or a word ñ Something that's different than my made up world
Your luck is changing ñ You wait and see ñ You've got a whip no end to crack it ñ On me ñ  ñ Unfortunately Time ñ Unfortunate to be ñ Unfortunately mine ñ When fortunes hard to feel ñ Unfortunately time ñ When fortunes far to real ñ  ñ Your luck is changing ñ You wait and see ñ You've got a whip no end to crack it ñ On me ñ  ñ Unfortunately Time ñ Unfortunate to be ñ Unfortunately mine ñ When fortunes hard to feel ñ Unfortunately time ñ When fortunes far to real ñ Tonight
Nothing is nothing ñ And nothing is smaller ñ Smaller is boring ñ And boring grows taller ñ Nothing through nothing ñ And nothing through you ñ The sum is the same ñ There's still nothing to do ñ Flesh Harrower
You've bought all the happiness ñ But you still want more ñ Parade all that you possess ñ Though there's no one keeping score ñ Dreaming of vertigo ñ From the highest fame ñ Feeling the undertow ñ When it starts to break ñ  ñ Everything will fall awa---- ñ  ñ A cage of the tangible ñ All you had to own ñ You poor social cannibal ñ What's left when you lose the throne? ñ We're of the same affair ñ Pride before the fall ñ We'll see what's truly there ñ When it takes us all ñ  ñ Everything will fall awa----
This is your brain on drugs ñ Check this out ñ This is your brain on drugs ñ I was like that before i started ñ This is your brain on drugs ñ See ya around buddy boy

A broken dream ñ Hangs over life ñ I feel no pain ñ I feel nothing ñ Like empty shells ñ Like coffins ñ Dead ñ Just emptiness ñ Just emptiness ñ Judas
Some say that doubt's disappointing ñ But I say to question is to understand ñ And I won't swallow poison ñ Of faith placed in faith in experience ñ Sometimes I'm lost in a circle ñ The beast of human nature breathing in my face ñ And I won't pretend to ignore him ñ Emotion starts to sway but truth won't fade away ñ I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe ñ I can't pretend to, I can't pretend to I can't pretend to ñ I can't pretend to understand everything
Come, gather around, you posh politeriots ñ Come, introverts, come, socialites ñ Come, little class mediocrates ñ Come, virtual monkeys ñ Come, junkets, come, junkies ñ Citizens of the declined ñ But be wary as you witness this tale of woe ñ For the story could be your own ñ In our soiled souls ñ A sadness is sold ñ Weep, as you watch it grow
Go to sleep, baby child ñ Go to sleep, my little baby ñ And hush-a-bye ñ Don't you cry ñ Go to sleep, my little baby ñ When you wake ñ You will have ñ All the pretty little horses ñ Black and blue ñ And sorrow, too ñ All the pretty little horses ñ Black and blue ñ And sorrow, too ñ All the pretty little horses ñ Hush-a-bye ñ Don't you cry ñ Go to sleep, my little baby

The dull thud of packing meat ñ It's my bare fist beating meat ñ I'm a meat eater and meat is me ñ I'm a meat eater bearing recoiled red teeth ñ With veneer forget-me-knots ñ I'll always be a part of you ñ With born again birth rite ñ Our baptismal names we lose ñ A soul's exit from a food source is quick, painless, and without force ñ I'll pick up the scent; i'll ride the rail ñ And it's easy hunting along blood trail ñ It skinned my life ñ It saved my hide ñ It drained my fluids ñ And carved out my insides
Walking up another day ñ To continue playing this game we play ñ I don't know who I am to you ñ And it's so hard for me to accept the truth ñ Seems like I'm playing the fool ñ 'cause everything you say, I do ñ It's so hard for me to choose ñ And if I say i'll take the blame ñ In the end it all stays the same ñ -we were meant just to remain

Circling the sky ñ Looking for prey ñ Fresh trail of blood ñ From the dead corpse ñ Feed on the flesh ñ Clawing the head ñ Stripping the skin ñ Eating within ñ Gouging the eyes ñ Gutting insides ñ Gnawing on bones ñ Beaks drip with blood

I guess I'll have to go out walking ñ I feel a blue mood coming on ñ Don't want to hear nobody talking ñ I just want to be alone ñ Every time I hear that music ñ It take me back to my old lady ñ Can't get my mind off that woman ñ Its about to drive me insane ñ I get a funny, funny kind of feeling ñ Like tear drops falling down inside ñ I guess I gotta keep on smiling ñ So folks will think I'm satisfied ñ Satisfied

Forsaken by His closest friends, treated like a thief ñ See them draw their weapons; see them draw their swords ñ See them draw their weapons; they draw their swords ñ He was taken like a criminal, His innocence among the thieves ñ Liars, false witnesses, scourged to please the crowd ñ With each lash the skin is torn ñ Lash upon lash, ripping flesh from the bone ñ He took our sickness; He took our sorrow. By His stripes we are healed

Sick and tired ñ I always admired ñ You from afar ñ You from where you are ñ Box it up ñ Send it around ñ Is it enough? ñ Give it a sound
Baby, pull me closer ñ In the backseat of your Rover ñ That I know you can't afford ñ Bite that tattoo on your shoulder

Summer's gone ñ Summer's gone away ñ Gone away ñ With yesterday ñ  ñ Old friends have gone ñ They've gone their separate ways ñ Our dreams hold on ñ For those who still have more to say ñ  ñ  ñ The nights grow cold ñ It's time to go ñ I'm thinking maybe I'll just stay ñ  ñ  ñ It's finally sinking in ñ One day begins ñ Another ends ñ I live them all and back again ñ  ñ  ñ I'm gonna sit and watch the waves ñ We laugh, we cry ñ We live then die ñ And dream about our yesterday
We built this life ñ We love this ride ñ Leave a stranger's house ñ Drive through the day southbound 95 ñ More broken than we came ñ 4 more shots to the gut ñ Let it burn go 'til we see the sun ñ Let it burn any given night ñ Crossing another state line we know we can never die ñ Rollin' too deep, but living ñ Never gonna die ñ We're riding to another town ñ We're showing up for another round
The consequences are mainly underrated ñ Flat glasses full, the prize inflated ñ Sharpen the weapons of your trade ñ To endure, as well as you gave ñ Spinning often, in a trance ñ The surface smooth, don't take the chance ñ Aqua plane in torrent pelt, skid across MacAdam's belt ñ Was it a miracle? That's how it felt ñ Launch into attractive space, falling from that pure state of grace ñ 52 feet per sec per sec per sec per sec ñ To free my mind and break my neck
Don't forget your life in line ñ Don't forget your screaming child ñ Don't forget your innermost feelings ñ I found the evil in me ñ To keep me company ñ Crowding the solitude ñ And their brief multitude ñ Subjection! ñ No man ñ No woman ñ No child alive could please me now ñ Don't embrace this filthy lad ñ Covered with evil sand ñ Find a shelter underground ñ Confess to the god you found
Can't see the other side of your face ñ But I know that it is mean ñ I can try to start over this week ñ But it can't change the way I feel ñ  ñ Can't see the other side of your dream ñ But I know that it is real ñ I can try to change the way I think ñ If it makes you happy then I will ñ  ñ Take me away, I don't want to stay ñ Can't you tell I am in pain?

If you look into a distant corner of our galaxy you will see a halo of ñ Light ñ A brilliant ring of fire ñ And inside this halo of light a star is being born ñ A star that will burn for billions of years ñ And when it dies it will give birth to new stars ñ And they will burn for billions and billions of years more ñ I tell you this because just like that star ñ You are beautiful ñ And just like all the stars that follow ñ My love for you is eternal

It's safe to say ñ I'm walking a lot ñ It's safe to say ñ I'm thinner ñ It's safe to say ñ If we don't find food soon ñ We won't make it ñ Through winter ñ I'm walking ñ Now running ñ I'm picking up steam ñ I'm threatening ñ To expire ñ I'm going to make it ñ We're going to make it ñ Before the cows come home ñ Before the cows come home ñ Before the cows come home ñ It's safe to say ñ I'm walking a lot ñ It's safe to say ñ I'm thinner ñ It's safe to say ñ If we don't find food soon ñ We won't make it ñ Through winter
I was born past midnight ñ Impure child of the rite ñ Fleeing from the light ñ Blood and wine will be mine ñ As the moon's shining bright ñ Disappearing in a flight ñ I was born past midnight ñ Blood and wine will be mine ñ I was made through the night ñ I was made beyond your sight ñ Cain's child, in the night ñ Lilith's tyke, in the night
Everything explodes from the inside ñ Saturating all of me and you ñ Everything within the chapel dies ñ And everything that you believed in, too ñ Godlike steel ñ I can feel your pain ñ Siding with the enemy of hope ñ Tearing down the walls of fantasy ñ I can't hear the words that he had spoken ñ Tearing down this frail reality ñ I see the light of day burning through my eyes ñ I stare anyway, severing my ties
Can you think about taking someone ñ Somebody known to you or ?? ñ Some see in time to see my tame tongue ñ Does it know it this time, I'll see the ceiling shape ñ 'cause i wonder what the taking lay what she can say to me ñ 'cause I don't say what ? can be higher in same ?...cause every time I watch you come home I see the way you're talking...
Get your day's work done ñ Get your day's work done ñ Or soon you'll be ñ Racing with the sun ñ Make your plans today ñ 'Fore the evening's on ñ Or you'll end up ñ Racing with the sun ñ Hard, hard, times ñ That you've had ñ Hard, hard times ñ But today you're mighty glad ñ Cause your work's all through ñ And your battle's won ñ Now you'll never never be ñ Racing with the sun
I look outside and wherever I go you are there ñ You colour in the everyday wherever I go ñ I look outside and wherever I go you are there ñ You colour in the everyday wherever I go
Can't believe how much I love you ñ I just hope that you love me to ñ I do, I do, I do ñ When you're gone it's so hard to breathe ñ Can't deny that it's you I need ñ It's true, I do, it's true ñ  ñ Gonna get high on love ñ Gonna get high on all your love ñ As long as you're mine, I know ñ No one can break me down, it shows ñ Love your smile and the way you talk ñ Love your eyes and the way you walk ñ I do, I do ñ I'll surrender, I'll give up ñ Need your kisses and soothing touch ñ I do, I do, yeah, I do
This is the body ñ This is the blood ñ Broken and poured out ñ For all of us ñ In this communion ñ We share in His love ñ This is the body ñ This is the blood ñ I will remember everything, Lord ñ That You've done for me ñ I won't take for granted ñ The sacrifice that set me free ñ I hunger and thirst for Your love ñ Come fill me today ñ We hunger and thirst for Your love ñ And Your righteousness ñ We long for Your presence here, Lord ñ Be with us again

Somewhere, somehow ñ Sometime, some place ñ I did someone wrong ñ And now I'm suffering with the blues ñ Don't know just where ñ Or why, or how ñ I must have been wrong ñ 'Cause now I'm suffering with the blues ñ Why does your love taunt me ñ Haunt me through the night? ñ When I know that you don't, oh want me ñ If you did you'd be here by my side ñ Somewhere, somehow ñ I must have hurt you deep down inside ñ Or why else would I be here ñ Suffering with the blues? ñ Oh-oh, why else would I be here ñ Suffering with the blues?

I left my conscience like a crying child ñ Locked the door behind me put the pain on file ñ Broken like a window i see my blindness now ñ I need love ñ Not some sentimental prison ñ I need god ñ Not the political church ñ I need fire ñ To melt the frozen sea inside me ñ I need love ñ Driving into town tired and depressed ñ Like a flare the streetlight bursts into an s.o.s ñ Peace comes to my rescue i don't know what it means ñ I need love
OK guys, let's break for lunch! ñ When my brain starts to fry ñ Its time to go and get Pad Thai ñ Pad Thai ñ Pad Thai ñ Pad Thai

Oh woe to the lamb of god ñ These are your last days ñ Feel the burning hatred, feel the pain ñ Your destruction is imminent ñ Resistance is futile, you die ñ I am the Maggot Crusher ñ You shall fear my name ñ I am the Maggot Crusher ñ You shall fear me ñ I am the Maggot Crusher ñ Fucking fear me ñ I shall spread devastation ñ I shall bring pain ñ Once i am thru with you ñ Nothing is the same ñ Oh woe to the maggots of god ñ Crushed pieces of shit you are ñ Dead insects, dead god ñ Fear the Maggot Crusher ñ Fear the Maggot Crusher
A mark of claws ñ To teach us. Speak to us ñ The language of vultures ñ Woven towers, they grew ñ As our maps became patterns ñ Of what always had been ñ Yet never came ñ Oh how we tried not to fall ñ And now fail to fall ñ Now try to fail. And fall ñ One will always build from the cinder we left ñ White walls arise from a trembling ground ñ We will not stay here in the reigns ñ White walls arise from a trembling ground
My heart's treasure darling is you ñ Please believe me darling it's true ñ You're so precious my heart wants to hide ñ My good fortune deep down inside ñ My heart's treasure I'll never share ñ Earthly riches cannot compare ñ My heart's treasure will always be ñ The love that you gave to me ñ My heart's treasure will always be ñ The love that you gave to me

Get the body butter, baby ñ Lets go party alone ñ You can feel the love that's coming ñ On and off, and on and off ñ Faith is a horrible song ñ Get the body butter, baby ñ Lets go party all night long ñ You want my hands and, you want my hands out ñ Take the hundred with the seamen and the (???) ñ I know my love was here for a minute ñ It was on and off, and on again ñ Wait for the feeling of the ride ñ But I can see right through your mind ñ You seem like the lonely kind ñ Hand out, you want my hands out ñ You want my hands
Somewhere between where we say and we do ñ We knew ñ Bottle back ñ Quick with burn ñ To burn this away
Can it be? Do you hear? ñ A new freedom song is ringing ñ No more dark, no more fear ñ There's a new day that it's bringing ñ Something simple is the key ñ Only love will set us free ñ It's so far, it's so near ñ Almost close, almost here
Sitting in the corner of a room, thinking of you ñ Wondering what you're doing now we're apart ñ No use crying, tears can't reach you now ñ Memories, fulfilling dreams ñ  ñ You used to be, so good to me ñ I can't live without you ñ I'd like to be, in your fantasy baby ñ Part of you is me, wo ñ  ñ Walking across the clouds, hope I see you there ñ Be it day or nighttime, I don't really care ñ Hope you see me too, before I meet my end ñ Someone stole my life away, I can't pretend
Alone with all the things that I've done ñ Living and thinking in minutes ñ My small days spill into light years ñ Now I can pretend ñ To live a life of starting over ñ Forget what I used to be ñ To live a life of starting over ñ Forget what I used to be ñ There are dead stars whose light is trapped forever in time ñ Dead stars whose light is trapped forever in time ñ Dead stars whose light is trapped forever in time ñ (Dead stars whose light) ñ How can I stand inside the light? ñ How can I stand inside the light?
Baby, what you hiding from? ñ Maybe you should taste the sun ñ Baby don't you wanna come ñ With me? ñ  ñ Maybe, baby, it's you ñ Ooh, it's you ñ Baby I care for you ñ Ooh, I do ñ  ñ Baby, don't you wanna see? ñ Baby, don't just leave me be ñ After all, it's you and me ñ You're the one ñ  ñ Maybe, baby, it's you ñ Ooh, it's you ñ Baby I care for you ñ Ooh, I do ñ  ñ (You're all I really need) ñ (You're all I really need)
Ahhh ñ I want, I don't know ñ  ñ  ñ I'm screaming "Why" ñ I'm screaming "Why" ñ I scream "Why"
You can run, you can hide ñ But you'll never escape the fear of darkness in everyone's mind ñ Only the bravest of souls should take this journey with me ñ For our travels will reveal terrifying visions of agonizing death ñ And horrible nightmares ñ Listen if you dare ñ Only the bravest of souls should take this journey with me ñ Listen if you dare ñ Only the bravest of souls should take this journey with me
Chicago steals the stars in the sky ñ At least it's willing to share ñ Thanks for keeping me in mind ñ But I think I'll stay in tonight ñ No more bike rides late at night ñ No more walks home under streetlights ñ But those lights wake you up ñ When the trains put you to sleep ñ But those lights, but those lights wake you up ñ When the trains put you to sleep
Silent night, Holy night ñ All is calm, all is bright ñ 'Round yon Virgin Mother and Child ñ Holy Infant so tender and mild ñ Sleep in heavenly peace ñ Sleep in heavenly peace ñ Silent night, holy night ñ Shepherds quake at the sight ñ Glories stream from heaven afar ñ Heavenly hosts sing Alleluia; ñ Christ the Savior is born! ñ Christ the Savior is born! ñ With the angels, let us sing ñ Hallelujah to the King ñ Christ the Savior is born ñ Christ the Savior is born

Run through the rays of the rising sun, the sun ñ Together we'll fall. Falling into white light our all, in awe

Up and out in the emptiest of places ñ Day after day got to steal the chances ñ My vision blurred through these tears that keep falling ñ I'll make the most of the life Ive been given ñ As the world keeps going around ñ Will you hear the crying sound ñ As the sun break through the clouds ñ Let's go! ñ We Glow ñ We Glow ñ We Glow ñ Inside the head a cycle of repetition ñ No time to stop and to flip the direction ñ It's automatic it's my way of survival ñ I'll make the most of the life Ive been given

Look into your eyes and I can see the future ñ Listen to the radio I hear the past ñ Somewhere in between my heart lies in confusion ñ Somewhere later on I might know what I need ñ Chorus: ñ You worry me ñ You caught my heart on your line ñ Hard as it may be ñ I take one day at a time ñ One day at a time ñ One day at a time ñ Standing alone my arms are tired and are aching ñ Standing across from me your arms reach out for mine ñ Lying alone my legs are tired and are twitching ñ Lying next to you my body warm and free
Climb the fibrous ladder dear friend ñ Watch your head ñ Watch your step ñ Chained meat-hook your new ally and playmate ñ Hang yourself from the virginal I-beam above ñ Hang from your anatomically correct eye sockets ñ A perfect match for the grapple ñ Hang like the meat you have been farmed to become ñ Hang raw and arrogant ñ Watch the gold-wash ñ Watch the spin and spit ñ Sweat, drip, foam and hiss ñ Hang like meat ñ Dangle in indifference ñ Suspend above the spectators ñ Fresh meat sways ñ Rotted pride withers ñ Raw

I don't want nobody ñ Slipping round ñ Don't let me see you ñ Sneaking down ñ Lawdy mama ñ Got to say ñ Bye, bye, birdie ñ Fly away ñ I used to love you ñ Love you day and night ñ But since you left me ñ Things is coming right ñ I don't go no places ñ Late at night ñ Sleep eight hours ñ Feel alright ñ Lawdy mama ñ Heres the truth ñ Bye, bye, birdie ñ Off my roof ñ I used to love you ñ Love you day and night ñ But since you left me ñ Things is coming right

Into the abyss I fall ñ And dark is the reich of the dead ñ A portal to reach to the side ñ Where bodies fall from the sky ñ Solitude and peace of mind ñ Entombed in Cromlech ñ Yes, flee over the River Styx ñ And join the dead with joy ñ An ocean of blasphemy ñ Heathenish realm ñ And "Do What Thou Wilt" as decoy ñ My Prophecy is true... ñ We'll all make it through
Dream in black and white ñ Model cities, shooting up, in the sky ñ Did they go to sleep, just to die, just to drown, in the air? ñ Look under the bed ñ There's no ghosts, that I can see ñ Tires burning ñ Can't go back there ñ Can't go forward ñ What does the word vacancy mean, when you don't expect anything? ñ Don't even try to justify, there's no way to justify
I hear voices and I can see ñ A all things are changing around me ñ Accept our youth, accept the truth ñ Total destruction and destiny ñ Of our nature why can't you see ñ Accept our youth, accept the truth ñ I hear voices and I can see ñ All things are changing around me ñ Accept our youth, accept the truth... die Zeit

Sesh ñ  ñ Sitting on the stu ñ Fresh bowl of fruit ñ The sky is turing electric blue ñ The clouds are pink ñ My eyes are too ñ Bloodshot can't even move ñ I watch the sun when it rise up ñ And I watch the sun as it go down ñ And I watch the moon come up everynight ñ Shits unreal it's never slowing down ñ  ñ Its raining outside ñ I love the rain ñ I love the ocean ñ I love the eclipse ñ I love the water ñ I love the coffee ñ I love the whiskey ñ I love you ñ I love you ñ I love you ñ I love you ñ I wish I wasn't a robot
No one but you could take my heart before you came ñ No one but you could make my heart burst into flame ñ Now I hear myself confessing ñ All the dreams I've been suppressing ñ All at once my lips are blessing your name ñ Your hands are cool, your eyes are warm ñ Your smile is bliss ñ I'd be a fool to fear the storm that's in your kiss ñ Let your kiss destroy or save me, so shall it be ñ Till life is through, no one but you for me
Walking out in the freezing rain ñ I feel nothing 'cause I numbed the pain ñ I'm lookin' forward to lookin' back ñ On this day ñ Prayed last night ñ Dear God please no ñ But I was never good at letting go ñ I'm lookin' forward to lookin' back ñ On this day ñ Good news can be so unkind ñ When it's everything you have to ñ Leave behind ñ I'm lookin' forward to lookin' back ñ On this day ñ In the taillights ñ So much hindsight ñ Telling me what I already know ñ I know

I never wanted to be invincible ñ I never claimed to be immune ñ To all those vices and the scheming thoughts ñ To all those old heartbreaking tunes ñ I never cared that much for honesty ñ I never cared that much for pain ñ Don't believe that good will conquer evil ñ Or tired lies be washed off by the rain ñ But it's a funny thing ñ They always tell you ñ That time can heal the hardiest of woes ñ But time is just one word that means 'forever' ñ And where forever ends I'll never know ñ Where forever ends I'll never know
A shady street of fog ñ A whistle blows, a train slowly moves on ñ You wave once more ñ And draw your gun ñ You lose yourself aghast ñ In twilight dreams and sweet regrets ñ And maybe you'll forget ñ What you've become ñ We sang like nightingales ñ Of happy fits and childhood fairytales ñ Forever setting sail ñ Into the sun ñ Nightingales ñ Nightingales ñ Nightingales

So many words ñ So many words for me to ñ You know that you're a ? ñ So many times ñ Someday we'll be ? ñ Someday, we'll be eyes in the garden ñ So many times we were the ones to reach the hallowed walls ñ Cause if you don't, they tie you up and pull you into fault ñ And you are dear ñ You know that you are dear
The air will promise me ñ Its rifle down my back ñ It lives around my bones ñ Can't await the will ñ Infiltrate the soul ñ It keeps me feeling small
You know, i think it's fucking great ñ When you're in the E.R. after breaking your face ñ You'll go in the pit to push everyone around ñ And i won't help you when you hit the ground ñ The problem's not violence ñ The problem is you ñ A dumb jock loser ñ With everything to prove ñ I love it when you get hurt ñ It makes me feel good ñ To see you get hurt ñ Dancing hard is all you're good for ñ Casualty of the core

Where Do You Run ñ (Brewster-Neeson-Brown) ñ There you go -- ahead of the rest ñ You say you're the first, but first ain't the test ñ Places you go ñ But you don't know who's left ñ The strangers you know ñ You have learned to impress ñ Look around, you make a break ñ With every chance you take ñ Where do you run ñ How do you love ñ You know you got it all ñ But can't get enough ñ Look at you, the night is your cross ñ I heard you cry -- you've been wasted and lost
I open my eyes to the breathtaking splendor of brand new skies ñ I come alive ñ Heart pounding ñ Voice resounding ñ This is the sound of my rebounding ñ A creator's brand I bare ñ And forfeit the scars of a love to share ñ This is the sound of foundations shaking history in the making ñ This is reformation ñ This is love overtaking ñ This is the sound of redemption ñ This is here ñ This is now ñ This is love overtaking me
Deck to dock ñ Chardonnay ñ Ropes are taut ñ Escape escape ñ Clutter to cure ñ You must unmoor ñ I feel you deflate ñ From the waves ñ In your wake ñ The rush is slow ñ Sister speedboat ñ Look at you go ñ Give yourself a gift ñ Don't give yourself away
Where did you come from? ñ You're no stranger ñ How I know you will return ñ So I won't be sad ñ D.A.R.L.I.N.G... ñ  ñ In this harbor of a room ñ You'll find your anchor soon ñ In the parting of our ways ñ May it never happen, any way ñ  ñ In the highest blackened moon ñ There'd be more life ñ In the right shade of our sighs ñ Death be gone ñ D.A.R.L.I.N.G... ñ  ñ In this harbor of a room ñ You'll find your anchor soon ñ In the parting of our ways ñ May it never happen, any way ñ  ñ All of your charms ñ Couldn't keep you from...
The ocean wind cold on our lips ñ Wild fern growing, sinking ships ñ All the signs are easy to read ñ  ñ In the morning you come my way ñ Your skin is pink, the sky is gray ñ There's fresh cranberries in your mouth ñ With thick red water dripping out ñ You expect me to believe everything you say ñ Well, okay
I've had enough ñ To break me in two ñ To tear me apart ñ What am I to do? ñ What else can I do? ñ So sing me a song ñ Let me hum along ñ At the top of my lungs ñ While I come undone ñ What else can I do? ñ What can I do?
(I love you) ñ (I love you) ñ  ñ Huh? I... I don't hate anyone! (I love you) ñ But, I... I don't hate anyone! I... ñ I... I don't hate anyone! ñ (I love you) ñ I don't hate anyone! But... I... ñ I don't hate anyone! But... I... ñ Huh? I... I don't hate anyone! (I love you) ñ But, I... I don't hate anyone! ñ But, I... I don't hate anyone! ñ (I love you) ñ I don't hate anyone! But, I... ñ I don't hate anyone! But, I... ñ I don't hate anyone!
Take my hand, I'll be your guide, I'll lead you to the sacred place ñ Your body is chosen to become the mortal remains of our god ñ Reincarnation of his soul right into your dying corpse ñ Your worthless soul will be disposed; dispossession of your life ñ The God of Death is born again, his soul lives on in human form ñ Examining mortal man in his own human shell ñ When the time is right for him he'll leave this world as a king ñ Followed by millions of souls that will join him in the Netherworlds....

The last millennia were dedicated to ñ The forces of light ñ Of selfrighteous hypocrisy ñ Of denial and Puirtanism ñ Deceit and despair ñ Futuristic paranoia ñ Visions from a dark millennia ñ Where god has failed ñ And mankind shouts ñ And kills with joy ñ A bloody holocaust of flesh protects ñ The earth ñ Not the times have changed ñ Mankind has thrown ñ Of it's morals and laws ñ Social Darwinism ñ To the extreme ñ Weed out the weak ñ And soon the liberation will come ñ Pitiful humans did you believe ñ The aeon of Aiwass was for you?
Skip softly, my moonbeams, avoid being seen ñ Pretend that perhaps you are part of a dream ñ Which (seen by some other such person as me) ñ Would only glow smiling and nod and agree ñ Skip softly, my moonbeams, for I have heard tell ñ That the stairs up to heaven lead straight down to hell ñ That pride is the last thing which comes before fall ñ I'd as soon talk to you as make love to a wall
I'll write an eighties album for your honor if you just text me back ñ I know you're really busy with all you're doing now with cell phone technology, still you can not message me
(Claude S.) ñ Blue little rose ñ You are crying ñ I am trying ñ To let you know that I love you so ñ Sweet little rose ñ Let your petals sway ñ On your lonely days ñ In the wind of my heart ñ I can help you see ñ What it's like to be ñ Taken from the garden ñ Where you grew up with me ñ I can set you free ñ If you just run to me ñ All the thorns will go away ñ If you stay with me ñ Little rose...
You use your heart as a fortress ñ  ñ Armor on ñ You use your heart as a fortress ñ Ticking bombs ñ All the weapons are useless ñ So can you just let down your guard ñ Before everything is marred? ñ Armor on ñ You use your heart as a fortress ñ  ñ You use your heart as a fortress ñ How'd you get so far, far? ñ Far, far ñ How'd you get so far, far? ñ Far, far ñ  ñ How'd you get so far away? ñ How'd you get so far away? ñ You use your heart as a fortress
I heard this ñ I heard that ñ What do I believe? ñ It's hard to give ñ It's hard to get ñ And once you've lost it it's always gone ñ I know I shouldn't accept ñ One person's word as truth ñ Without at least ñ Giving you the benefit of the doubt ñ I get so mixed up ñ By the things you say ñ And the way you act ñ Too many times ñ This has happened before ñ I always thought the wrong thing ñ I never gave you a second chance ñ Now it's happening all over again
Going back to California ñ So many good thing around ñ Don't want to leave California ñ The sun seems to never go down ñ Some people may treat you ugly ñ Some people beautiful too ñ That's the way life is all over ñ Look for the good things for you ñ California ñ There's a good place to be ñ California ñ That's where I'm feeling so free ñ California ñ I'll be back there before long ñ I'll be back there before long ñ I'll be back there before long
Woe Woe Woe Woe! ñ Almighty Jah, I can feel your power ñ In my life ñ I can feel your power my lord ñ In my mind ñ Woe Woe Woe Woe! ñ When I close my eyes and think ñ About the sacrifice ñ Of your son on the cross ñ I will never forget ñ Your love my Jah ñ Woe Woe Woe Woe! ñ When I close my eyes and think ñ About the sacrifice ñ Of your son on the cross ñ Thats why I come to you ñ To say thank you Jah ñ For all the things ñ You have done for me ñ I just wanna say, thank you jah
This is where a thousand devils ñ Wait in the darkness to destroy your mind ñ This is where a queen of angels ñ Defiles herself every time ñ In the heat and in the slumber ñ Ever here to drag you under ñ Paradise, Inferno of anguish ñ Every time the poison kiss ñ Dark side of love ñ Here the monsters in the shadows ñ Beautiful seraphs of desire ñ Here is lust beyond good and evil ñ Here the Beast pure and vile
A look behind my back ñ And everything I believe in ñ Is crushed to little pieces ñ Egoism and greed rule ñ Your stupid life, my friend ñ Feed your children your flags ñ And live your shallow life without me
Beckoning, the abyss roars behind ñ All-consuming nexus of might ñ Falling, observing am I ñ Ascending, transcending space and time ñ Traversing the deafening divide ñ I soar towards the gateway inside ñ Therein storm long-confined ñ Elements, chaos, and light ñ Seething for aeons bright ñ A thousandfold intensified ñ Mortal flesh cast aside ñ Eternity before my eyes ñ Passing through the paradigm ñ I behold, but dare not describe
Oh, whisper ñ Oh, whisper ñ I look for you, you look for me too ñ We'll find, we'll find each other in the deep blue sea ñ Don't wanna be without you ñ Don't wanna be your pause ñ Only time, only time can slow us down ñ And if we reach each other ñ Some day are hands will touch ñ And will no one else will matter ñ Whisper ñ Whisper ñ Oh, oh, oh, oh ñ Don't wanna be your  ñ Don't wanna be without you ñ You can whisper, whisper in my ear
Stale air flushed colors the finger prints rub through. i feel like wasted energy staring down mile long halls distorted sighs leave me shaking i am figuring out that it's hard to breathe in

Sundark on darker streets. its violent times for weary feet ñ Carjackers and bullet showers. a yellow sign. too many fools in power ñ But see. i will be gone by morning. my dear friend i lost a fight ñ Forget me. i wash my hands in your grey slowing night ñ Coming down from darkened heights. i taste the thames with my cycle lights ñ By saint paul's by big ben. by god's name, i repent ñ But see. i will be gone by morning my dear london goodnight ñ Forget me, i wash myself in your grey river light

Hunger grows in the alliance ñ Enslaved souls can't see ñ In the circle of the force ñ Death to them all! ñ In honour to the goddess of protection ñ The lifeless hordes ñ Have nothing to see ñ Eclipse of their eyes ñ Armageddon will come ñ Lifeless souls will die ñ In the name of the force ñ Beyond no life ñ In honour to the goddess of protection
Had a thought that consumer goods were bad ñ Like a rat can never beat the wheel ñ There is a wiretap stealing a nightmare ñ Shadows laughing and making deals ñ Let your hair hang down for this moment ñ Heavy trial but we'll make it disappear ñ They can't take away ñ This underground dream ñ Guns or education ñ The answer's larger than the Hollywood sign ñ Bigger souls can see the writing ñ On the burning wall of eternity ñ The bastions of penitentiary ñ Reaction will pull broken hearts through ñ The can't take away
I drove away another word to value ñ So I'd grow without you ñ Still I wake up in your arms ñ Dreams have lost their charm ñ Hanged and torn I live through this ñ Though it's through....I'll save it all away ñ Memories of a glass sanctuary ñ Memories of a glass sanctuary
And I won't stop loving you
Feels so much colder, now you're away ñ Blue room in Archway ñ Searchin all the places you could be ñ And I can feel your ghost over me ñ Four walls ultra marine ñ Lock myself away ñ Blue room in Archway ñ Searchin all the places you could be ñ And I can feel your ghost over me ñ And it's hard to define my reasons ñ For hiding away ñ Cursing the day when I leave ñ Can't you read the sign on my window ñ Why don't you leave me alone ñ Blue room in Archway
Dis groove is bad!
The blanket shit coverage we get on TV ñ Sells us paradise, buy buy buy buy buy buy it ñ They steal our lives and sell them back to us ñ As one big happy contraceptive pill-popping party ñ Based on the ad-man's philosophy ñ That total self-indulgence equals total freedom ñ Total self-indulgence equals total freedom ñ Like freedom from involvement ñ Freedom from concern ñ Freedom from responsibility ñ Freedom from love ñ Freedom from love ñ Freedom from love ñ Freedom from love?
I love you like a stream flows restless to the sea ñ See you like the mist touches clouds, touches me ñ See you in the stars wherever you may be ñ I think of you, think of you ñ If ever you're near and have some time to spend ñ I love you every way, love you like a friend ñ And then when you leave a whisper in my mind ñ I think of you, think of you ñ When I see a bird fly over to the sea ñ And the sun in the sky is shining warm and free ñ And when I feel the wind blow cool over me ñ I think of you, think of you
I bear these scars ñ A constant reminder of my own inadequacy ñ I've held everything and nothing all at once ñ And all at once been altogether broken ñ But even scars fade with time ñ Only You remain ñ And my determination is not enough ñ Even so, I bear these scars
No hope; no love ñ No trust ñ No fun ñ No peace ñ No mirth ñ No calm ñ Before ñ Ah-uh ñ Ah-uh ñ Ah-uh ñ Ah-Uh ... ñ No right; no help ñ No truth ñ No worth ñ No light ñ No end ñ No hope ñ Before ñ Destruction
One, two three ñ Five, six, seven
You tell me not to love you ñ But boy, all of you makes me want to ñ You tell me not to love you ñ And I, I only wanna hold you ñ I only wanna sway with you ñ Because uhh ñ Talk to me, whisper and ah! ñ You're gonna take me, aha! ñ Take me where I wanna stay ñ I'll keep your little secret ñ But I know you cannot keep it ñ I'll keep your little secret ñ Your eyes ñ They tell me that you want me ñ They say you wanna play ñ With me ñ Because uhh...
Maybe I should have saved those left over dreams ñ Funny, but here's that rainy day ñ Here's that rainy day they told me about ñ And I laughed at the thought that it might turn out this way ñ Where is that worn out wish that I threw aside ñ After it brought my lover near ñ It's funny how love becomes a cold rainy day ñ Funny, that rainy day is here ñ Funny how love becomes a cold rainy day ñ Funny, that rainy day is here
What is this that stands before me? ñ Figure in black which points at me ñ Turn 'round quick and start to run ñ Find out I'm the chosen one ñ Oh, no ñ  ñ Big black shape with eyes of fire ñ Telling people their desire ñ Satan's sitting there, he's smiling ñ Watches those flames get higher and higher ñ Oh, no, no, please, God, help me ñ  ñ Is it the end, my friend? ñ Satan's coming 'round the bend ñ People running 'cause they're scared ñ The people better go and beware ñ No, no, please, no

She don't want to go ñ She don't wanna know ñ She is just staring at the wall ñ She is only thinking, what went wrong ñ She is out of work ñ She is out of love ñ She has nothing to hope for ñ She doesn't live here anymore ñ End is a new start ñ The depression is gone ñ You can open your eyes now ñ Get your life back ñ Let's get out of this trap ñ The future is now

You're a god charade ñ I'll let you down like a noise complaint ñ I know my cover's blown ñ Fetish and fury tax ñ Worshipping everything I lack is dumb ñ Invention strung ñ Into empty space where hollow shapes will misbehave ñ What does holy want? ñ I'll be that Picturesong ñ Make me into a hundred words ñ Hide me in bathroom walls ñ It's a spastic shame ñ That hollow shapes will break the frame ñ What does holy want? ñ A wind up Picturesong ñ A muse to sing a dozen words ñ A silence for the wall
"...For Ubbo-Sathla is the source and the end. Before the coming of Zhothaqquah or Yok-Zothoth or Kthulhut from the stars, Ubbo-Sathla dwelt in the steaming fens of the newmade Earth: a mass without head or members, spawning the grey, formless efts of the prime and the grisly prototypes of terrene life... And all earthly life, it is told, shall go back at last through the great circle of time to Ubbo-Sathla."

When the dragons grow too mighty ñ To slay with pen or sword ñ I grow weary of the battle ñ And the storm I walk toward ñ When all around is madness ñ And there's no safe port in view ñ I long to turn my path homeward ñ To stop a while with you ñ When life becomes as barren ñ And as cold as winter skies ñ There's a beacon in the darkness ñ In a distant pair of eyes ñ In vain to search for order ñ And in vain to search for truth ñ But these things can still be given ñ Your love has shown me proof
What is your color ñ Show me your color ñ What is your color ñ Show me your color ñ What is your color ñ Show me your color ñ What is your color-r-r-r-r ñ And shine bright ñ Shine bright ñ And shine bright ñ Shine bright ñ What is your color ñ Show me your color ñ What is your color ñ Show me your color ñ What is your color ñ Show me your color ñ What is your color-r-r-r-r
Something surmounted me took away the will from me made me lose myself ñ Somewhere there's a place for me ñ Somewhere in this big city people still get a thrill ñ Was I too cynical? ñ Reparations could be made ñ But this island has lost face slipping with each wave into the ocean ñ Brown faces turning old ñ The sand was wet with kisses as we lay and dazed for hours against the sand where it is warm and laughed between our eyes and held each other in the moment as we watched it go

I can make a promise ñ I can make a plan ñ I can make a difference ñ I can take a stand ñ I can make an effort ñ If I only understand ñ That I, I can make a change ñ You can make a difference ñ You can make it right ñ You can make it better ñ We don't have to fight ñ You can make an effort ñ Starting with tonight ñ 'Cause you ñ You can make a change

Ooh, lucky old sun ñ Ahh, lucky old sun ñ  ñ Lucky old sun ñ Lucky old sun ñ That lucky old sun ñ That lucky old sun ñ  ñ He rolls around heaven all day
Traces in snow ñ A red line grows through and leads me below ñ Nothing on this side ties me ñ One step, one glimpse of an eye ñ One moment can change everything ñ Wait here 'til my words spread across the sky ñ And into the chambers of every soul
A fear forms I cannot name ñ Pulsing in waves of sine ñ In gaunt rooms, in pallid light ñ And flatlines ñ In faith I drank as from a spring ñ Yet a bane makes itself in me ñ And thirsts for the very things ñ I despise ñ Though by no choice of mine ñ I see through my mother's eyes ñ I look to a newer world ñ With the sunrise ñ Where birthrights endow; ñ Not to burden and bear ñ But bless and bestow ñ And baptize as heirs ñ But I'd be received with sighs ñ As the bane of my mother's pride; ñ As a stranger inside her womb ñ Yet outside
Will add later
When I look upon these burialgrounds my heart sighs ñ Deep is the dark, so it my heart ñ My black seared heart is the way ñ From the cold clouds above rains ñ Dust of death ñ In my mouth, in my breath ñ The cold struck urge for pain ñ Increases the lust to gain ñ Reign of knowledge ñ My apcalyptic vision at its very peak ñ My black seared heart can wait no longer ñ The force deep desertion has grown stronger

You, my friend, deserve things like spring as reference to your majesty. But nothing draws conclusion in the bones of your face when you've dismissed a kiss right off the lips and straight into the gutter of my life. Here, where my body was left empty and tormented for years, caked by the loose skins of an oversized heart, finally worn too thin
You follow me ñ Everywhere that I go ñ You're in my dreams ñ Oh my god ñ You're haunting me ñ You're in the air ñ You're in my head ñ Oh my god ñ I can't be still ñ Even in my bed ñ Oh my god ñ You're in my head
Lyrics From Snippets ñ  ñ Yeah (Ooh, ooh) ñ  ñ It ain't up to you no more ñ God's Country, this is war ñ Hold up son I make the storm ñ Roll the dice I make it four ñ It ain't up to you no more ñ God's Country, this is war ñ We was quiet when he rose ñ Now I'm talkin' to the boss ñ I'mma talk to you ñ  ñ Waking up, I see the light ñ I been up, initial right ñ See they leaping up my legion ñ I teared it up and it's alright ñ Every time I got it all ñ Tearing up and watch 'em fall ...

Here we go again ñ We'll carry on, my only friends ñ I'll take one chance ñ Without compromise ñ There isn't anything left, to try ñ Here we go again ñ We'll carry on but then again ñ We couldn't take this on ñ The story goes unformed ñ As if we never were there at all
Fields, as far as the eye can see ñ Filled with human remains ñ Scorched to their feet ñ They were all praising the Sun ñ And this was their reward ñ Now they form the army of ash statues ñ Into the shadows you must flee ñ And whom ever can find a path there ñ Shall become the king! ñ And from that stone made domain ñ Shall the destiny of all remaining lives be made
Choking on these feelings ñ This awakening has been at arms length for too long, it's hard to ñ Accept when all I had was their words ñ I've seen the devil and I've kissed the mouth of sin ñ Bloodshot eyes and senses heightened I am seeking to get in ñ These chains no longer bound me ñ I'm shedding my skin once again ñ In the year of the snake I was born into a world of pain and heartache ñ Isolation was the key to unlocking my soul now the story will be told
Ten thousand miles even though I roam ñ I can hear the call of the hills of home ñ The canyons high and the valleys low ñ Echo how can you stay away ñ My dreams are there where the eagle flies ñ Where the mountain tops seem to touch the sky ñ The winding streams and the winds that blow ñ Ask me how can you stay away ñ Far too long have I stayed apart ñ From this land that I love and divide my heart ñ Now, now I know I must go ñ Where the hills say don't stay away ñ Where the hills say don't stay away
Fear get away from me ñ Doubt has no place in me ñ Seduction of death will go ñ Intermittent thoughts of past life ñ I do not know that man ñ Anymore ñ Nevermore ñ Weight has lifted ñ Is broken ñ That yoke destroyed ñ I've nothing more to do with it ñ Peace deep within ñ I'm set free ñ I have become something else ñ My spirit breathes freely again ñ That yoke destroyed ñ I've nothing more to do with it ñ No longer tormented ñ No longer
I'm up late ñ I'm in a rough state ñ Ten thousand hours on my path to being great ñ I get by ñ You wanna know why? ñ 'Cause after the show, well you know I'm getting high
I'm a thousand miles from nowhere ñ Time don't matter to me ñ 'Cause I'm a thousand miles from nowhere ñ And there's no place I want to be ñ I got heartaches in my pocket ñ I got echoes in my head ñ And all that I keep hearing ñ Are the cruel, cruel things that you said ñ (Chorus) ñ I've got bruises on my memory ñ I've got tear stains on my hands ñ And in the mirror there's a vision ñ Of what used to be a man ñ (Chorus x2) ñ I'm a thousand miles from nowhere ñ I'm a thousand miles from nowhere
Poured myself out ñ I am the empty cup ñ My hope has died away ñ When hope dies away when he says I'm running ñ How can I keep stability on such shaky ground? ñ With prayers that a smile will flag me down? ñ I tire of longing ñ Is it too much to ask to want to be held by anyone with any arms? ñ Another morn alone ñ Waiting by the phone ñ This one's for the world: I love you ñ Am I trapped inside? ñ Life could get no colder ñ I'm living out a dying cell ñ Come over ñ Become part of my singular pronoun
You let the dark in, somehow ñ I feel the winter more now, more now ñ Some things do matter, a price to pay ñ We will find our own way, always ñ Sharks swim around your drowning soul ñ Let your good heart lead you home ñ Once you've gone, you can't come back ñ I am worried about you ñ Once you've gone, you can't come back ñ I am worried about you ñ Once you've gone, girl, you can't come back ñ I am worried about you
I hope I never give up ñ So afraid I'll break the skin ñ Do you feel the pain I own? ñ Can you see the pain I love? ñ Wrap my arms around my dreams ñ Wake up to an empty room ñ When will I have hope? ñ When will I have hope again for this world I hate? ñ With every ounce of flesh I will strangle self to a new way, new way of life ñ Wrap my arms around this dream of apathy ñ Strange lust of self conceived inveracities ñ Never give in... never!
I was something else ñ I could be someone, I could be somewhere else ñ I wish I was there ñ It's on ñ Let it go ñ I wish I was there ñ I could be someone else ñ I wish I was there ñ 'Cause it's on ñ So let it go ñ Don't follow it instead ñ Just let it go
I want to be with you ñ But sometimes life becomes too real ñ I want to see the things ñ In my heart I know I feel ñ I write a song in my head ñ Pretend that I'm lying in your arms ñ But I know I'll see you sooner ñ Spray painting flower petals red ñ  ñ I want to be with you ñ But sometimes life becomes too real ñ I want to see the things ñ In my heart I know I feel ñ And you turn me off at night ñ Pretend that I'm lying in your arms ñ But I know I'll see you sooner ñ Spray painting flower petals red

Falling is tough, looking for love ñ But all that I see is pulling me below ñ Baby tonight, if it's alright ñ Let's shut it out and then just let it go ñ  ñ Can we forget what we know ñ The room is spinning and I'm feeling the highs ñ Baby we're electrical ñ If you want we can light up the sky ñ  ñ Let's make mistakes tonight ñ Let tomorrow wash away our sins ñ Don't be afraid of heights ñ Yeah I'll take you where you've never been ñ All I want and all I need is feel alive ñ I just wanna live tonight
Someone is calling her shorewards ñ Much like horses ñ Raising dogs will sing to me ñ Hold back the tears in my comfort ñ We move forward ñ In these pauses the storm corrodes ñ Maps of a lift to a scaffold ñ On a nursery floor ñ Begs aloud not to stay ñ Cut from the stone in the quarry ñ This old friend of mine ñ In his silence the storm corrodes ñ Passed on the second hand slips outwards ñ Born in the carcass song drips endless ñ Thrown out the boy believes the secret ñ Grown up the dogs begin to reach it
One little kiss, a moment of bliss, then hours of deep regret ñ One little smile, and after a while, a longing to forget ñ One little heartache left as a token ñ One little plaything carelessly broken ñ Remember the night ñ The night you said, "I love you" ñ Remember? ñ Remember you vowed ñ By all the stars above you ñ Remember? ñ Remember we found a lonely spot ñ And after I learned to care a lot ñ You promised that you'd forget me not ñ But you forgot ñ To remember
"The high office of the President has been used to foment a plot to destroy ñ The President John Fitzgerald Kennedy ñ In a speech made to Columbia University on Nov. 12, 1963 ñ Ten days before his assassination ñ Americans freedom and before I leave office ñ I must inform the citizen of this plight." -JFK
Cut out ñ What could be hurt ñ What could be wounded ñ What's in your way ñ What feeds emotion ñ This is perfect
Crawling through a ditch in the woods, two arms gone and a blood lusting thirst hits harder than a gang rape in prison. I'm turning into a zombie. Throwing up mucus and pus in your face before I eat you like a buffet of fried chicken on Black church Sunday. Zombie. Lars. Pass me the brains
My all-out abandon, the light stumbling. My fate is this way. I guard against everything. All wound up like a spring with gold filigrees, it escapes by other vents, a sudden missed heartbeat. The background of a midnight conversation. Little to me and you, small worried indignation. Remaining only mouths like Braille to the sighted, our words cani? 1/2 t rest on them, the burden never lightened
Below my solitude I abstain ñ Above my bitterness I grace the lie ñ Sinking alone I severed the chord, drifting into the wide ñ It lies below this tragedy, this suffering ñ Life's blood flows out of me ñ The deeper I sink the more life flows out of me ñ Drifting towards the light I see ñ Torn from my home to be ñ Hook clawing at my flesh guiding me through my journey ñ Drowning in a see of rusting faith ñ Killing your dreams with bleeding mistakes ñ A part of her dies too
Silent night, holy night ñ All is calm, all is bright ñ Round yon virgin mother and child ñ Holy infant so tender and mild ñ Sleep in heavenly peace ñ Sleep in heavenly peace ñ Silent night, holy night ñ Shepherds quake at the sight ñ Glories stream from heaven afar ñ Heavenly hosts sing alleluia ñ Christ the savior is born ñ Christ the savior is born ñ Silent night, holy night ñ All is calm, all is bright ñ Round yon virgin mother and child ñ Holy infant so tender and mild ñ Sleep in heavenly peace ñ Sleep in heavenly peace
I am here, in silent fear ñ Waiting for you ñ No one can see, the hurt I feel ñ It pulls, it tears, my soul ñ Chorus: ñ You don't feel ñ You don't care ñ Your so wicked ñ Take away, take away ñ This cross I bare ñ This burden shared, won't pull me down ñ Won't hold me down ñ (Chorus) ñ Smile she said, turn your head ñ Walk away ñ It's in your hand, your hands ñ Your hands ñ (Chorus)
Awaiting the final hour ñ Before I go away ñ Awaiting the darkness ñ I have nothing to fear ñ When the soul leaves the body ñ Blanket of bloody stains ñ There is nobody ñ When I leave for the astral plains ñ This is the solution ñ For your problems ñ Death will come and make you free ñ Never me, eternally ñ After death has come ñ I'll be released and free ñ For eternity ñ But when you're gone ñ There's no reason to be sad ñ As long as someone loves you ñ You won't be dead
One tenth of her ñ I feel her talking through my stand-up hairs ñ Which of you - Huh? Huh? - or does he touch them or is he daft? ñ It's hard, boys, alone and old ñ It's really like her ñ It wears her clothes ñ I might be, I might be ñ But you're not me, and you don't know ñ I'm back in the mine ñ Back in the mine ñ Don't be afraid my love for you to die ñ It stands its ground as I stand mine ñ The ex-flesh of the temperature ñ You're just as beautiful as your light allows

I've been cheated ñ Been mistreated ñ When will I be loved? ñ  ñ I've been put down ñ I've been pushed 'round ñ When will I be loved? ñ  ñ When I find a new man ñ That I want for mine ñ He always breaks my heart in two ñ It happens every time ñ  ñ I've been made blue ñ I've been lied to ñ When will I be loved? ñ  ñ  ñ When I find a new man ñ That I want for mine ñ He always breaks my heart in two ñ It happens every time ñ  ñ Oh, I've been cheated ñ Been mistreated ñ When will I be loved? ñ When will I be loved? ñ Tell me, when will I be loved?
So hard to know ñ What to keep what to let go ñ So apropos ñ Love's a poison I'll drink it slow ñ I'm the fool you play ñ With both wings clipped I'll fly away ñ So hard to see ñ I've looked at both sides so closely ñ Remember me ñ Love's a poison I'll drink it slow ñ I'm the fool you play ñ With both wings clipped I'll fly away

But the third sister, who is also the youngest ! ñ Hush ! Whisper whilst we talk of her ! ñ Her kingdom is not large, or else no flesh should live ; but within that kingdom all power is hers ñ She droops not ; and her eyes rising so high might be hidden by distance ñ She is the defier of God. She is also the mother of lunacies, and the suggestress of suicides ñ Deep lie the roots of her power ; but narrow is the nation that she rules ñ And her name is Mater Tenebrarum - Our Lady of Darkness

Pour submission into me ñ No church shall bar our paths ñ Seductive evil drink... ñ Your fill of the bleeding christ in your arms ñ Where scorn is fed in the blackest fucking soul!

You got a diamond ring: it's just another hollow thing ñ You got your career: you chose boredom over fear ñ You got a righteous cause: all I see are fatal flaws ñ You got the newest style: it won't be new in a little while ñ You got the future, too: I don't mind leaving that to you ñ You plans & goals: all I see is full of holes ñ You got the human race, & you got Jesus just in case ñ You got your eternity: a few short years is enough for me ñ I got my defiance - you got your genetic science

Forward tales to tide ñ The boat turns toward the port ñ With fire and mud stained sky ñ Bright aft time ñ Bright aft time ñ My whole burden is laid down ñ Stay here ñ Stay here ñ Stay

I need to be lost and found ñ People will think that I have to run away ñ Can't exist like a king without crown ñ They even don't know what to think about
Semen tastes ñ Like gunmetal ñ She said ñ Smiling ñ The arms of boys drowning in fire ñ Reaching for the rungs of my rib cage ñ These pills I take ñ In the witching hour ñ I imagine ñ I am swallowing you
Oooh ñ It's plain to see ñ Why there's no harmony ñ Arrogance at a glance ñ A mind that's bent on ignorance ñ Desperate for reverance ñ Little king with no respect ñ Spitting out rhetoric from the mouth of a broke dick ñ A blind approach that leads to misery ñ Bitterness will let you down, and shut you out ñ Bar-b-que broke dick
Lyrics from Snippet: ñ ... Close to the light, yeah ñ Didn't get to say goodbye to you ñ But I feel like I never ...

I found my place in the sun ñ Lied my way there ñ I looked in your eyes ñ I'm coming clean ñ  ñ I've made up my mind ñ I've made up my mind ñ To lie would be to compromise ñ To lie would be to compromise ñ And I won't try ñ  ñ I'm sorry ñ I hope you, I hope you'll forgive me ñ But what you want from me ñ Is killing me ñ  ñ I've made up my mind ñ I've made up my mind ñ To lie would be to compromise ñ To lie would be to compromise ñ And I won't try
Born on a highway ñ On a freeway ride ñ Eagles come riding in the morning light ñ You better run and hide ñ Find the one you love ñ Eagles fly in the morning sun ñ Eagles fly in the midday sun ñ Eagles fly, eagles on the run ñ Eagles fly ñ Ride on the highway ñ Hear their engines scream ñ Eagles in motion ñ A thousand CC dream ñ You better run and hide ñ When the morning comes ñ You better run and hide ñ Find the one you love ñ Eagles fly in the morning sun ñ Eagles fly in the midday sun ñ Eagles fly, eagles on the run ñ Eagles fly

All is lost ñ My will to live was taken today ñ The fire that used to burn ñ My heart, blown out cold ñ By winds too great to hold at bay ñ All is lost ñ Purpose and cause, betrayed ñ Humility torn from my fingers ñ Snatched ñ Hope has turned and clouded grey ñ Who will take the pain ñ And shield me? ñ Shape my heart and never leave me ñ Empty or invisible ñ Who will take the pain away? ñ Who will take the pain away?
Last call for the bloodsuckers, heaters, and parasites ñ You're been relieved of duty, so let's call it a night ñ You'd better sleep tight, and get your head right ñ No more backdoor deals, it's not a fair fight ñ You're beating plowshares into swords and taking your glad-handing bullshit on tour ñ When those promises are broken we'll be scratching at your door ñ And who needs D.C. when I've got D4?

It's funny how my life just fall apart ñ I slept through days and nights like a perfect prince ñ Then it come crashing through the walls ñ Of lies and silence in my head ñ  ñ It's time to go before we came ñ And I know that we can't stay the same ñ  ñ Imagine that all you know ñ Are what you were told to care about ñ Now after all this time ñ You find your faith is fading ñ  ñ But it's time to go before we came ñ And it only takes a second to turn yourself
Departure from your body ñ Pilgrimage in your mind ñ Believe me you might need ñ A closer look at what's behind ñ Concentrate on fusion ñ Soul and mind is one ñ Meditation trance ñ Your thoughts no longer bound ñ Seen enough ñ Psychotic stuff ñ Stark insidious hell ñ Burning with ecstatic fire ñ In your mortal shell ñ Wrought from non-existence ñ The shape is taking form ñ Called upon ñ To take the throne ñ Reaching like a spire ñ Beyond flesh and bone ñ Towards all but saving grace ñ Shattered infinity ñ Mirrored in your face
I'm flyin' ñ I'm flyin' high like a bird ñ But my fluttering wings can't keep you from pullin' me down ñ Your mama ñ Your mama says I'm a fool ñ And yeah, maybe that's true 'cause I can't stop thinkin' 'bout you ñ  ñ  ñ I'm tryin' ñ I'm tryin' not to forget my words ñ 'Cause when I'm around you I tend to keep changin' my mind ñ I promised ñ I promised myself not to slip back into old habit ñ 'Cause heartbreak is savage and love is a bitch

Everyday we see so many suffering. We watch old friends end up right in the arms of misery's company. We watch those we love get ripped from our hands before we had a chance to set them free. It's a constant struggle to remain standing, jaded, restless, but I'm still standing on my own feet
You know who I love - nobody ñ You know who I trust - nobody ñ You know who I fear - nobody ñ I prayed a thousand times ñ He never answered me ñ Do you think I've sinned ñ In the eyes of the lord ñ He never did shit for me ñ I stand alone in this world ñ Trust and faith ñ So long forgotten ñ You and I ñ We are forsaken ñ Just fucking kill me ñ Put me out of this pain
Years of being told you ain't as good as us ñ Join the line and sign your name ñ And they said that our city's going bust ñ But no-one's fooling us again ñ (Coro:) ñ New York belongs to me ñ A city's pride the dirty water on the Hudson river ñ No one can take away the memory ñ Oh Oh, New York belongs to me ñ We'll show the world that the boys are back to stay ñ And you all know what we can do ñ Heads held high, fighting all the way ñ For the red, white, and blue ñ (Coro)

The switch is made ñ Waiting for deliverance ñ It's hot in July ñ My appetite wet ñ Under surveillance ñ Rising from the gutter ñ His fate is sealed ñ Forever ñ Worn out by the constant grind ñ You've got to take it now ñ Forever betrayal ñ Forever betrayal ñ I've been framed ñ I've been framed ñ Feel the backlash ñ Feel the backlash ñ Picked out of the chorus line ñ A knife in the back ñ Switchblade clicks open ñ Take your last look
I wanted to take white trash t-shirts and make it a video. I wanted to make it as phony as possible. I wanted to show you that this is the type of imagery that has been presented to us for years, and the only difference is a black man in the middle.
Are you into it? ñ Are you into it? ñ Are you into it? ñ (Okay, that was the end of it.)
You keep me walking in light ñ And you keep me walking outside ñ You keep me decieving in me ñ And you keep me staring on you ñ You are made of sun ñ Take me to the light ñ You are made of sun ñ Take me to the light ñ Try to achieve in your smile ñ You were able to conquer my eyes ñ You keep me decieving in me ñ And you keep me staring on you ñ You are made of sun ñ Take me to the light ñ You are made of sun ñ Take me to the light
Took your soul out ñ Took your soul out ñ Took your soul out ñ Soul out ñ Took your soul out ñ All that's left is the procedure ñ Took your soul out
A worthless prospect ñ Spraying the wall with your rancid semen ñ Trembling, completely useless ñ Your pants around yourself ñ Society, a diseased pack of impotent cannibals ñ A pestilent collection of vapors ñ You leave pools of piss like a nervous dog
I found a faded photograph of you ñ Clearing out this crowded room ñ See me so proud, dressed up to the nines, sipping dandelion wine ñ Did it seem the sun would never set... ñ We'd stay young, forever blessed in our Sunday Best ñ But I'm Wednesday's child and I am cursed to stay ñ Locked inside your purse ñ It's night and I'll come to you once more ñ I'll forget to use the door...Did I startle you? ñ Oh no... Not me ñ For you see through me... It hurts

Sailing on the sea ñ Beggars on the street ñ Oceans of sound ñ Locked doors when we're getting home ñ With no mouth of duct tape ñ Duct tape mouth ñ Every song has a different object ñ When it gets sung ñ Walking in the waves
We're satellites, we're everything and nothing ñ We're so alive, we're endless like the sky ñ We're satellites, we're crashing in the ocean ñ So alive, we're satellites ñ We're satellites, we're everything and nothing ñ We're so alive, we're endless like the sky ñ We're satellites, we're crashing in the ocean ñ So alive, we're satellites ñ We're satellites, we're everything and nothing ñ We're so alive, we're endless like the sky ñ We're satellites, we're crashing in the ocean ñ So alive, we're satellites
Talking on the telephone ñ Nothing to say ñ Empty conversation ñ Heading my way ñ Pointing the finger ñ Placing the blame ñ Tired of being negative ñ Sick of the pain ñ  ñ Faded to action ñ Fill in the blanks ñ No more distraction ñ Thanks but no thanks ñ Fill in the blanks ñ  ñ Just an empty feeling ñ Searching my soul ñ Change of disposition ñ Reaching a goal ñ Need some direction ñ Which way to go ñ Make a connection ñ Just go with the flow ñ  ñ  ñ No more distractions ñ Thanks but no thanks ñ Fill in the blanks

Moments like this make me thrill through and through ñ Careless moments like this close to you ñ Nonchalantly we'd dine and we'd dance ñ Yet my heart seems to melt in your grace ñ Sweet moments like this with the soft lights aglow ñ Make me long for your kiss though I know ñ I'd be just one of all your affairs ñ But at moments like this, who cares ñ I'd be just one of all your affairs ñ But at moments like this, who cares
Fire burns everything ñ Nutrients which have been stored in the vegetation remain in the ashes, enrich the soil and thus make cultivation possible ñ Make cultivation possible ñ After the rainy season when the ashes have been absorbed into the soil, the Maya plant ñ With a simple digging stick, they bore holes in the soil and plant their seeds
I cut off my ears on purpose ñ To deny and defy this instance ñ We have too many things to say to each other ñ So why not speak at all? ñ You... bite... my... tongue! ñ What was the secret anyway? ñ And why would I give it away? ñ And why not bite my heart out too? ñ Would I give it to you? ñ You... bite... my... tongue!

I ñ I am so blind ñ Burning, darkness dividing ñ Need to go alone ñ Seems it's always mine ñ I ñ Swell under light ñ Turning, enemies to find ñ Need to go alone ñ Seems it's always mine ñ To lead it on all again ñ Do we know our defence? ñ Reel it in all again ñ We don't know our defence ñ At all ñ To lead it on all again ñ Do we know our defence? ñ Reel it in all again ñ We don't know our defence

I'll never let a day pass by without a prayer or two ñ That heaven find a way so I might just run into you ñ Just to be near you and to hear you say hello ñ Would give an ordinary day a lovely glow ñ I'll never let a day pass by but that I'll see your face ñ And thrill to every tender sigh while you're in my embrace ñ I know it's all a dream but darling, if it were true ñ I'll never let a day pass by without my loving you
I'll not contain you ñ I  won't look for you in my room ñ  ñ Through  lengthy talks I'll not contain you ñ Through climbing arms I'll reach my loft ñ Through rotting skin I'll leave my coffin ñ Through  calloused work I will grow soft ñ  ñ My  eyes narrow towards a light ñ A blurry place where we hotly radiate ñ Things  are never concrete there and we never die ñ Not a heavenly illusion, just Earthly fate ñ  ñ And here I'll not contain you ñ I'll not contain you ñ And  here I'll not contain you

In January, I took the short walk ñ Down to the Broadway Bridge ñ Two and a half blocks ñ When you scrape the ice away ñ You can read the bridge dedication ñ  ñ I could feel the cold air coming in through my teeth ñ I saw the bridge, I saw the water underneath ñ That's a whole lot of water ñ That's a whole lot of water ñ  ñ I took out the key that I'd forgotten the function of ñ Twisted it from the keyring as the bridge loomed above ñ I hammered it against the ice ñ I hammered it against the ice
Immortal electric infinite universe ñ Animal soulless place controlled by emotion ñ Out think, Displace ñ Evolve, Escape ñ Mutate, Deface ñ Disguise, Outpace ñ Devious underground ñ Ruling class shifting tongues ñ Out think, Displace ñ Disguise, Outpace ñ Open fire or evolve, Mutate ñ The whole shit-house goes up in flames ñ This is war to exterminate ñ Electric storms of violence sweep the planet ñ Time to escape ñ Puppeteers camouflage criminal interests ñ Devious animals controlled by shifting tongues

Wring out that bartender's rag ñ And let it wipe away my blues ñ You ain't got a lot of call to use it ñ And it will help me more than it will you ñ Wring it over ice cubes with a cherry ñ Red as lips that told me we were through ñ Limes and lemons, words that came between us ñ Sour as that bartender's rag brew ñ  ñ No one could have told me I'd be singing out the strains ñ Of what any man with sense would be pouring down the drain

There's starlight in your eyes tonight ñ The shimmer on your face really sits with me right ñ I said I wish I may and I wish I might ñ Take your hand and make it so that everything's alright ñ Sittin' in my chevy at the Hollywood sign ñ Starin' at the moon with lovely thoughts in my mind ñ Of a cloud with fluffy wings on a pink dawn sky ñ The same pink on your cheeks when I asked if you're mine

Behold fools deceiving fools ñ The blind leading the blind ñ You're lost among the lost ñ And you cannot breathe ñ Slowly killing yourself ñ You're wasting away in fear ñ Traded your soul to escape your misery ñ Lost Among the Lost ñ The days you've always feared ñ Now have arrived ñ It's closing in on you ñ Your world is breaking loose
Cooked corn in formaldehyde ñ Popcorn in an airtight jar ñ Corn flakes under glass ñ A second sun was discovered on May 21
The empire never ended ñ Nothing's really changed ñ I know the way it must've felt ñ When visions burn,they sometimes melt ñ And fade away like tracks in snow ñ When nothing's left it's time to go ñ The empire never ended ñ Nothing's really changed ñ I saw the bloodlust disappear ñ Noone really cared ñ I painted my devils angel blue ñ And ran around without a clue ñ Back to Source ñ Only on the LP-version of the album?
Fire conquers the ice ñ Frost melts away, the forest can breathe ñ Sound filling the air ñ The song of the bird and hammer on steel ñ Hear the call from afar ñ We tread a new path, spreading the seed ñ Shine, lady of light! ñ Empower the soil, strengthen the yield ñ Summer's flame riding high ñ Golden spears rain on the land ñ Eager souls now fly free ñ Winter's chill a distant dream ñ Summer's flame riding high ñ Golden spears rain on the land ñ Far and wide, seas of green ñ Days burn long into the eve
I know I can be cruel ñ I say a lot of things I don't mean ñ And I'm not always in the mood ñ To give you what you need ñ But I come close you gotta ñ Love me love me love me or leave me ñ I know I act confused ñ I'm perfect just like you ñ Do what you want ñ But there's no one in this world ñ Who would die for you ñ There's only me ñ You won't ever find ñ Anyone around as good as me ñ There's only one choice ñ You don't wanna grow old all alone
Here, right here ñ When it's too much for me to take ñ They can't see straight ñ When it's too much for you to take ñ You're the only one ñ You're the only one ñ I'm the only one ñ You're dressed in black & following the purple string ñ So run towards your fears ñ When it's too much for you to take ñ I can't believe the way you breathe ñ On the mirror leaves often marks ñ I draw your name inside the cloud ñ You laugh ñ So what begins?
The stars that shine are yours and mine ñ The rainbows in the sky are yours and mine ñ The song of springtime, the lullaby of fall ñ The sunshine of summertime belongs to us all ñ The moon above is yours and mine ñ The right to fall in love is yours and mine ñ The hope of finding the dream our hearts desire ñ All this is yours and mine
I spent recess hiding in the bathroom ñ I was my only company ñ I could not face people ñ I tried to befriend inanimate objects ñ I was more worry than human ñ I was ruining my own life ñ I spoke to my burden, it says it wants to kill me ñ Everyday I am me ñ Everyday I have to be ñ I have to be ñ I have to be me em eb ot evah I eb ot evah I
Change my pitch up.....Smack my bitch up ñ Change my pitch up.....Smack my bitch up ñ Change my pitch up.....Smack my bitch up ñ Change my pitch up.....Smack my bitch up ñ ....Smack my bitch up ñ Ahaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa ñ ....Smack my bitch up ñ Change my pitch up.....Smack my bitch up ñ Change my pitch up.....Smack my bitch up
Lyrics From Snippet ñ  ñ  die by the gun ñ Say me and my dogs , feeling like the one (Ooh Yeah) ñ And I never go no where without my gun
Snap our skulls shut ñ Spark off yesterday ñ Phantom brain headaches ñ Such a loud laugh in the platinum sun ñ The platinum blasted sun ñ Cuz you're uh wired ñ You just crumple up ñ You just tumble down ñ Don't you? ñ I mean you know you do ñ Said a mouthful through a mouthful of ñ Ginger ale and love ñ Lift our platinum son ñ Us two shall pass ñ We're made of glass ñ It's complicated ñ You just crumple up ñ You just hunker down ñ Don't you? ñ I mean you know you do
The plans are made in perfect concentration ñ For maximized projected profit share ñ Except for a microscopic complication ñ I know cause I'm the one that put it there ñ  ñ Twitch on the hand ñ Taking ñ Sweet shining thing ñ Ticking ñ  ñ The hackers and the loudmouths are my heroes ñ But I'm just too polite to be like them ñ So quietly I make my complications ñ Happy watching crumbling from within ñ  ñ Twitch on the hand ñ Taking ñ Sweet shining thing ñ Ticking
Misaligned misaligned ñ Where does my allegiance go? ñ My heart spits soul ñ That's just the way it goes ñ Cut off t-shirts make me feel fierce ñ And you're the dearest to my heart ñ Duplication of the commmunique
Stagnant strangers romance on crowded pathways ñ Below admiring the stage's glistening coat ñ Her reflection on the sill ñ Giving the cheekbones their due ñ Praising the worth of porcelain skin ñ My shades of blonde dancing in the high sun  ñ I gave labor to the grief ñ To the squinting spectator ñ Who drank in the despair ñ As i tiptoed off the plane of existence and drifted listlessly ñ Through the velvet blackness of oblivion ñ I am what I always was - Gleaming and empty  ñ I am what I always was
Did you say something about tomorrow ñ I say, what about today ñ I wish you were here today ñ But why does anybody say anything they say anyway ñ Why does anybody say anything they say anyway ñ Did you say something about tomorrow ñ I say, I'm scared enough for today ñ Too scared of repeating yesterday ñ But why does anybody say anything they say anyway ñ Why does anybody say anything they say anyway
This jet-age life is getting worse ñ I feel I'm half a universe away ñ I left my home some time ago ñ To fight the creatures of the USA ñ You tell me that this neon world is free ñ Say this is the place I ought to be ñ The time has come for me to go ñ You say it's far too, feeling slow today
Don't kiss me quick ñ I'm about to be sick ñ All over my favourite shoes ñ If you pin back my tongue ñ With a stapling gun ñ It won't stop me from singing the blues ñ I'm as drunk as a skunk ñ And the National Front ñ Have kicked me all over this bar ñ I'd go back to Ian's house ñ But Ian's house is to far ñ The pinch and the punch ñ Were for the first of the month ñ The slap for the rest of the year ñ The punch and the kick ñ Were for being to quick ñ And the rest ñ Was just for being here
TIME WILL ñ SUBSIDE ñ DON'T TRY TO HIDE IT ñ YOU'RE MADE OUT OF NOTHING ñ DESTROYED AND DIVIDED ñ YOU'RE LEFT WITH NOTHING ñ BUT TIME WILL ñ SUBSIDE ñ DON'T TRY AND FIGHT HIM ñ HE'S FORKED LIKE A WICKED PATH ñ WON'T FIND WHERE HE'S HIDING ñ HE'S GONE AND HE'S NOT COMING BACK ñ ANYTHING YOU WANTED ñ EVERYTHING YOU HAD
One chapter done ñ One chapter come ñ I look to the sun ñ That's where I run ñ Steadily learning ñ Steady we grow ñ I hold on to old friends ñ And welcome the new ñ All in due time ñ All in due time ñ All in due time ñ All in due time ñ This side and that one ñ I go in between ñ Let go of dead weight ñ Roam and be free ñ Grow old and stay young ñ That's how we live ñ Some they are taking ñ But we've come to give ñ All in due time ñ All in due time ñ All in due time ñ All in due time
Now that the snow has melted ñ And the birds sing sweet ñ In a long dress she runs through ñ Meadows in bloom ñ Where bees and butterflies dance through ñ The clover she falls into ñ Looking up to make out all shapes there in the sky ñ Wired for sound the tears well in her eyes ñ Listening to the band that came through town ñ The band whose drummer partied well ñ Who made her laugh but won't abide ñ Two pink lines
Broken boys ñ I like broken boys ñ I like broken boys ñ I like broken boys ñ I don't share my toys ñ I like broken boys ñ Who make lots of noise ñ I like broken boys ñ  ñ Oh my god ñ Dude she- uh, wait who is this girl? ñ That, that's amazing, damn ñ It's a good song though right? ñ It is, it's a very good song ñ Can I see this girl?
Becoming weary of your lies ñ You disguise the truth belies ñ Only fooling yourself ñ Pretend to bite the hand that feeds ñ But you won't discard your security ñ The transparency of your fantasy

Somewhere the children are out there playing ñ In the flower garden ñ And just like a painted doll ñ This could fall ñ The future's yours today ñ For just like a wild rose ñ Growin' in every garden ñ They're lookin' for someone ñ To show them the way ñ The flower children are the garden of today ñ And the rain is the tears ñ That are fallin' down ñ From the angels above ñ To let them grow ñ In peace and love
Oh mother is it hard to recognize me now ñ Oh mother why can't you recognize me now ñ I sent my letters, "Everything is fine" ñ But i lied ñ Little boy ñ Little man ñ I lost my name ñ Heroine ñ Where have you been when i needed you? ñ Little boy ñ Little man ñ I lost my name ñ Heroine ñ Where have you been when i needed you
The Beatles are dead ñ Andy Warhol's shit she said ñ Yeah, reactor, reactor, reactor ñ Give me a better foot in time, in luxury, in love ñ People said, he left her for another woman ñ But she knew he left her for another car, a velvet craft ñ We slide in shaking in the hole resting beneath the ground ñ Between the sun is cracks, it breaks above our heads ñ Holy water hoses the whole school white porcelain ñ Against my face squatting discreet and shit less concealed

When look at me ñ Just what is it that you feel? ñ Why are you afraid to ask? ñ The mirror stays the same ñ It's just the frame that's changed ñ Why is that so hard to grasp? ñ Before you throw that stone ñ Think of all that you condone ñ Think of what you let go past ñ I am not disposable ñ I am not controllable ñ I just can't see what you see as sense ñ I am not of no consequence ñ When you look at me ñ What is it you feel? ñ Why are you afraid to ask?

Hello love my old friend ñ Sure is good to see you again ñ I stood out, on the road ñ Just a watchin' the cars ñ A come and go ñ I felt empty, I felt bare ñ I really thought that I could not care ñ All the leaves are soaking wet ñ How succulent a little spring day gets ñ If you kiss me once ñ Out here in the rain ñ We'll go back and start all over again ñ So lift up every voice and sing ñ Sing to the tree tops ñ And everything ñ Say hello love ñ My old friend ñ Sure is nice ñ To see you again

What a damn day ñ For you to explain ñ Why when you dream, you dream of waves ñ Nothing belongs to me ñ I thought I had everything until it was over ñ And when the money dries up ñ Who's gonna pay for me to go to art school? ñ All the people who've got it never give it up ñ No, they never give me any
Here the call, look out on the road beyond ñ Through glass and blood that runs along the rusted can that's home ñ Ploughing through the cities dust and stench that's new ñ Local traffic stalled a while, Is this worth the drive? ñ Here the call, through hunger sweat and empty halls ñ An ethic of the pioneer, do it or die ñ Rest, rest up ñ Wrap your wounds, get back on the field ñ And breath, breath through the dust and mold ñ The cities stench, it fuels you
For no apparent reason had the women been drawn in ñ Where rows of dusty books lay in an ominous display ñ But one ancient leather binding had the grain of human skin ñ And seized with curiosity she stole this book away
Each doorway exists opening new worlds ñ One is born to obey ñ Another to destroy ñ Everyone is turning ñ Everything is circling ñ Lost on so many levels ñ Carving out my way inhaled so much freedom ñ Forgotten I'd escaped ñ Everyone is turning ñ Everything is circling ñ There is no reality ñ This is a mere dream ñ I can hear their footsteps coming closer ñ Forgotten so many moments ñ Forgotten so many ñ Time is my only cost time is my only loss
There's a cold bed in my room tonight ñ You make it colder ñ Colder than the moonlight ever thought it could be ñ Not half as cold as me ñ Sitting on the front porch ñ Trying to find a melody that will make you love me

I'm Arthur Gordon Pym ñ Or is he me? ñ Why is everything so grim? ñ Distress all I see ñ I'm not the victim ñ I'm just the subconscious creator ñ But if that's the truth ñ Why is there another hell after every grief? ñ Why do we always stumble into even deeper chasms ñ Further down, further down, Further South? ñ Whither should I flee from myself? ñ Further down, further down, Further South?! ñ Whither should I flee from myself? ñ Further down, further down, Further South?! ñ Further down, further down ñ Into oblivion ...
Lyrics from snippet ñ  ñ Hitmaka! ñ  ñ I'm out here, turnt up, flexin' ñ Young, I'm rich, I'm sexy ñ Whip brand new like freshman (Skrrt) ñ Cellphone bump real heavy ñ Call my line, don't text me (No) ñ Hot like June in Timpie (June) ñ My shooters be shootin', don't tempt me ñ  ñ She twenty-one tryna fuck a nigga like the only one ñ Strapped up, bust six times ñ And she .22, she my favorite gun ñ Just bought a brand new Ferrari ñ Threw my Patek in the garbage

Here in the wild ñ Nothing but two cold Klondike hearts ñ Charm of a dancehall girl ñ A true star of the north ñ Those precious 30 days ñ A letter in the snow ñ Love lost yet always there ñ A burning need of life ñ O Me! O Life! Here in the wild ñ Nothing but two cold Klondike hearts ñ O Me! O Life! Here in the wild ñ Nothing but two cold Klondike hearts

"Few people laughed, few people cried, most people were silent. I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad-Gita: Vishnu is trying to persuade the Prince that he should do his duty and, to impress him, takes on his multi-armed form and says, 'Now I am become Death ...' " ñ 'Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.' I suppose we all thought that, one way or another."

To bring us power, intelligence ñ Machines are running in our mind ñ When we dissect the natural elements ñ We see what left behind ñ Calibrate - to attack empower me - as they kill ñ In my dreams, I see the end ñ My fear prevails, I see machines ñ  ñ We will pay with our lives, back to the beginning ñ We are machines, breeding
Excuse my solecism ñ (but it's nothing unknown) ñ Looking back ñ Mistakes are always blinding ñ Selfishness and servanthood ñ Define inner vision ñ Strength liquefied by dissent ñ Don't be nervous ñ I'm far from the end of my rope ñ Loyalty proceeds theology ñ That consuming fire so faint will execute and regenerate ñ Excuse my solecism ñ (but it's nothing unknown) ñ That consuming fire so faint will execute and regenerate
Upon the shoulders of man, the head of the beast ñ Worshipped by the evil hordes, dark evil lord ñ Carnivorous ferocity, a breed that should not be ñ A master of devilry, in sand enthroned ñ Into the catacombs, the fires burn ñ Into the catacombs, the shadows yearn ñ So feared by all of light, plotting in the dark ñ To bring on full demise, so the dark will rise ñ And let creations crown ñ Feel vengeance coming down ñ Feel vengeance coming - down!
My heart tells me this is just a fling ñ Yet you say our love means everything ñ Do you mean what you are saying ñ Or is this a little game we're playing ñ My heart tells me I will cry again ñ Lips that kiss like yours could lie again ñ If I'm fool enough to see this through ñ Will I be sorry if I do ñ Should I believe my heart or you ñ My heart tells me I will cry again ñ Lips that kiss like yours could lie again ñ If I'm fool enough to see this through ñ Will I be sorry if I do ñ Should I believe my heart or you

I heard the news today ñ Billy's gone away ñ Left us all for good ñ No one understood ñ You only had to say ñ I would understand ñ You only had to say ñ Whatever come what may ñ I was feeling low ñ You called and you were too ñ We'd meet Saturday ñ It happened on Wednesday ñ You only had to say ñ It's sad ñ I would understand ñ I don't want you brave ñ A truce we made today ñ If you're feeling sad ñ On me you can depend ñ You only have to say
Love ñ Wake up ñ Do the stuff we make up ñ Love ñ We lay for weeks ñ Hands clasped grasping ñ Love, ante up ñ Love, raise your hand ñ Hearts are our cards ñ Drunk with our luck ñ Realise, one day ñ ????
On damp ground he walks ñ And lays the frost upon ñ The meadows and the moss ñ The hunt of fall is on ñ The archer and his bow ñ Roam in the valleys cold ñ Eleven brothers know ñ Again they're getting old ñ Rain, wind, fire, ash ñ Snow, arch, mist, death ñ With a whistling ring ñ His arrow cuts the haze ñ And his freezing breath ñ Resounds through the calm days ñ As the wheel hangs low ñ In snowy trees forlorn ñ The archer and his kin ñ Know they shall be reborn
I've walked this road a thousand times before ñ And never found what I was looking for ñ All the time I stumble and I fall ñ Still here I stand trying to be free ñ Yes I try to get on with my life ñ Taking one step at a time ñ I still can't fly ñ I try so hard to please ñ But never compromise ñ It took you to make me realize that I'm not by myself ñ I want you to be in my life ñ Cause I know you'll never say goodbye ñ For you I'd walk a thousand miles ñ I still can't fly
I opened up that old book ñ Photographs took me back ñ To your room ñ To your room ñ Pale green eyes ñ Strong and kind ñ I looked at a picture of Helen ñ I woke up in your room ñ Photographs took me back ñ To your room ñ To your room ñ  ñ I heard it in your voice ñ In a place so close
Now to know what's been gotten into ñ What once hurt is normal now ñ Hobbled and hands are tied ñ Life worthless and devoid of any meaning ñ Eyes are swollen and closing ñ Hands are ruined ñ Always hungry ñ Heads are hollow ñ Skin hangs loosely ñ Lack of sleep ñ Always watched ñ Pronounced fatigue ñ No motivation ñ Always wanting ñ Hope has ceased ñ No spark of life ñ No joy ñ Total resignation ñ No sympathy ñ Our curse ñ All the world a grave
Don't look back to the days of yesteryear ñ You cannot live on in the past ñ Don't look back ñ And I've known so many people ñ That still try to live on in the past ñ Don't look back, oh no ñ And if I could call back all those days of yesteryear ñ I would never grow old and I'd never be poor ñ But darlin', those days are gone, oh yeah ñ Stop dreaming ñ And live on in the future ñ But darlin', don't look back, oh no ñ Don't look back, oh ?
On a little street in Singapore ñ We'd meet beside a lotus-covered door ñ A veil of moonlight on her lonely face ñ How pale the hands that held me in embrace ñ My sails tonight are filled with perfume of Shalimar ñ And temple bells will guide me to the shore ñ And then I'll hold her in my arms, and love the way I loved before ñ On a little street in Singapore

People made of paper ñ Come and go ñ But shadows grow ñ Green behind ñ In a diary of wood ñ We found the things ñ That make us grow these worlds ñ An umbrella made of stone ñ And the focus that will turn to sand ñ You get the general idea ñ To call in all the troops ñ That are close at hand ñ Pretend you're a soup of sky ñ Past earth tonight ñ Let's send them photographs ñ From way outside ñ Way inside
People ask me ñ What I do with my time ñ listen ñ I dedicate my life ñ When you work ñ When you drive in cars ñ What I do ñ I dedicate my life ñ C'mon, c'mon ñ Listen ñ Yes ñ I dedicate my life ñ Like him ñ Like her ñ I dedicate my life ñ  ñ  ñ When you work ñ When you drive in cars ñ When you are on the internet ñ I dedicate my life ñ Like this guy, this guy ñ And this guy ñ I dedicate my life ñ C'mon, c'mon ñ Listen to the sounds ñ Yes ñ I dedicate my life
And so it begins, the circle ñ Life signs are vital ñ And I'm just a child but my shadow runs wild ñ Time to give up again ñ And I thought about ending it all yesterday but I never want to lose you ñ And I couldn't wait to find another way but I never want to lose you ñ Thoughts so young yet so final ñ Life signs are vital ñ I am the charging rhino & the dying baby sparrow ñ Time to give up again ñ That's your blood you're spilling too ñ From our hearts it floods right through
Really strange, confusing, unbelievable, weird, funny things come in pairs
A realm where everything is dead ñ Tormented souls and bodies without heads ñ This is where all dark and dead dwells ñ There is no paradise, this is hell ñ This is your eternal destiny ñ Dominion of the necrogods ñ They feast on your burning soul ñ Tear it apart to thousand pieces ñ Here you will forever stay ñ This is your eternal hell ñ There is no escape from the necrogods ñ Dominion of the necrogods
Oh, the time has come for parting ñ And the marching music ends ñ No matter where our lives will lead us ñ In our hearts, we'll still be friends ñ  ñ Though the time has come for parting ñ And the future lies unknown ñ  ñ Although the years may come between us ñ We will never feel alone ñ For friends we are now ñ And friends we'll stay ñ Until we meet again ñ One wonderful day ñ Although the time has come for parting ñ We'll be friends until we die
Black dog bit through the keeper's chain ñ Small and angry when the devil came ñ Sold my soul like a pocket knife ñ There was no moon, there'll be no milk as sweet ñ  ñ Tomcat curled on a rabbit cage ñ Brittle fingers in the potter's clay ñ Sold my soul and I laid her down ñ There was no moon, there'll be no milk as sweet ñ  ñ Blue bird laughs on a fallen tree ñ Sunset burns on a quiet sea ñ Sold my soul and they ran me down ñ There was no moon, there'll be no milk as sweet
(love) ñ Can make your world go 'round ñ (love) ñ Can really bring you down ñ (love) ñ It's such a state of mind ñ (love) ñ Can take a long long time ñ (love) ñ I've got to figure out love ñ (love) ñ It's such a tricky thing ñ (love) ñ Can include diamond rings ñ (love) ñ Will make you scream and shout ñ (love) ñ If there is no way out ñ (love)
I'm staring at the wall ñ Your flavor on my lips ñ I'm watching and I'm counting ñ All you left me with ñ  ñ Flies ñ  ñ I held your picture in the fan ñ I spilled your drink and your perfume ñ I share my love with those who join me ñ In this somber empty room ñ  ñ Flies ñ Flies ñ  ñ  ñ I pressed the pillow on your face ñ You didn't want my sympathy ñ You share your love for those who join you ñ Seven feet beneath the trees ñ  ñ Flies ñ Flies ñ  ñ Flies ñ You share your love for those who join you ñ Flies
The plot begins with you ñ And me in darklit rooms ñ Your cigarette cuts through ñ I wear it like perfume ñ The melody gives way ñ We silently behave ñ The story never read ñ Is torn up into shreds ñ I see it in your eyes ñ The invitation lies ñ But pages left to turn ñ Our chapters we should burn ñ The melody gives way ñ We silently behave ñ The story never read ñ Is torn up into shreds ñ I see it in your eyes ñ The invitation lies ñ But pages left to turn ñ Our chapters we should burn
Has no one said those daring ñ King eyes should be more learn'd? ñ Or warned you how despairing ñ The moths are when they are burned? ñ I could have warned you; but you are young, ñ So we speak a different tongue. ñ O you will take whatever's offered ñ And dream that all the world's a friend, ñ Suffer as your mother suffered, ñ Be as broken in the end. ñ But I am old and you are young, ñ And I speak a barbarous tongue.
Fateful ñ Thirst for dark horizons ñ Hateful ñ Infectious trepidation ñ My eyes ñ Can see so far beyond ñ The boundaries of your miscalculated sanity ñ So distant. I am threatening - infecting ñ Your existence
The Final Dance ñ The Final Dance

My God has rescued me ñ Taken my rags, and made me clean ñ Opened my eyes, so I could see ñ My God has rescued me ñ All I have ñ I give to You ñ I lay it at Your feet ñ I lay it at Your feet ñ (c)Michael J. Pritzl

Been a long time ñ Since i've seen your face ñ You've been on my mind ñ Like a dream i can't erase ñ It's time for me to come home to you ñ  ñ I'm on the road to heaven  ñ Coming home to you ñ  ñ Been a long time ñ Since last time we made love ñ All the things we used to do baby ñ All the things that made me fall in love ñ  ñ I'm on the road to heaven  ñ Coming home to you  ñ  ñ I'm coming home  ñ Coming home to you ñ Too long i've been walking around wondering ñ But i'm coming home to you
I dig myself to the center of the Earth ñ Then there was a hole ñ I crawl back and put a knock upon your door ñ But there was no one home ñ I'm not going back ñ I climb clouds to the bluest of the sky ñ But all I saw was air ñ I rain my love to the heads that breathe below ñ But none of them cared ñ I'm not going back
Are you against me or are you with me? ñ Are you with me? ñ Are you with me? ñ  ñ  ñ Is it a deathwish to doze off helpless? ñ Leave myself at the mercy of you ñ At the mercy, of you ñ And I be needing my sleep in peace ñ Need to trust you ñ At the mercy of you ñ  ñ You ñ At the, at the, at the ñ At the, yeah, at the ñ At the, at the the
Even still they are wondering ñ Is it so and is it real? ñ Touch and see and breathe it in ñ Only one knows how to feel ñ Cowboy, cowboy feel ñ Late at night he is wandering ñ For a poor misguided star ñ Dirt and sand what loves you best? ñ Time then money, salt and scar ñ In the dark when I think of you ñ Flesh and focus all around ñ Skin then dust and disappear ñ Only some know how to feel ñ Cowboy, cowboy feel ñ Cowboy, cowboy feel
Realize we're not that far away ñ We will chase the dimmest light of day ñ I'll slow you down with the sunset ñ I'll slow you down, we'll take it in ñ In the house the dust is floating free ñ We will reach, resisting gravity ñ I'll slow you down with the sunset ñ I'll slow you down, we'll take it in
He's the riddle what has two eyes that cry constantly ñ For your love you guessed it's me ñ He's the riddle who has two arms that long deseprately ñ For your love you guessed it's me ñ And your love was once all the treasure I'd known now that's gone ñ Gone on wings of a wild dream now I'm all alone ñ One more riddle what has one heart that beats faithfully ñ For your love you guessed it's me ñ And your love was once...

If I had a coin to throw into the well ñ I'd wish I had three more ñ If I had just three more wishes ñ I'd live three times or more ñ If I saw a shooting star ñ I'd wish I saw three more ñ If I had just three more wishes ñ I'd live three times or four ñ You cannot belittle me ñ For I am the black cloud ñ That is perched over your head ñ Following you around
Waiting for the bus, on a cold windy day, staring around something strange underway ñ Heart beats wild going blind, I can't walk I try to fly ñ  ñ Latent psychosis, latent, it's back again ñ Brought down in the box this could put us one up,blood sugar level is on it's way up ñ Breathing in deeply to take the spot kick, something inside my brain just clicked ñ Hanging around in a bar down town, place is packed sweating people around ñ Things you say the things I see, all begin to puzzle me
The talking animals say ñ When the moon's so big and yellow ñ It's called the killer moon ñ And if you look over your shoulder ñ It seems like we're being followed ñ By the killer moon ñ But we are not afraid of the killer moon ñ When I look into the sky ñ See the grey clouds racing by ñ Sends a shiver down my spine ñ I ain't lying I ain't lying ñ The talking animals say ñ When the moon's so big and yellow ñ It's called the killer moon ñ But we are not afraid of the killer moon
How much do you think you know? ñ The truth hides behind all these walls ñ In the end reality ñ Will let you be who you can be ñ Will let you be who you can be ñ Will let you be who you can be ñ Will let you be who you can be ñ Will let you be who you can be
Walk that walk ñ Talk that talk ñ Walk that walk ñ Talk that talk ñ Walk that walk ñ Talk that talk ñ Walk that walk ñ Talk that talk ñ Walk that walk ñ Oh, talk that talk and walk that walk ñ Talk that talk ñ Walk that walk ñ Talk that talk ñ Baby, you look so good ñ Come on baby ñ Walk and talk ñ Come on baby ñ Walk and talk ñ A-when ya' talk to me ñ You know you look so good
Oh, you crawled out of the sea ñ Straight into my arms ñ Straight into my arms ñ Oh, you crawled out of the sea ñ Straight into my arms ñ Straight into my arms ñ Oh, you crawled out of the sea ñ Straight into my arms ñ Straight into my arms ñ Oh, you crawled out of the sea ñ Straight into my arms ñ Straight into my arms
I'm waiting for something to come through ñ I'm hoping I can write a real sweet tune ñ No passion, no warmth in these words ñ I'm trying, but have nothing to offer ñ I'm waiting with nothing to do ñ I'm waiting, just waiting on you ñ Sadly, just like before ñ It's lifeless, and soulless, and yeah, I fall way short ñ No beauty, no sweet melody ñ No four-part barbershop harmony
Maggie here's a thank you song ñ For being kind to me ñ To my friends a thank you song ñ For being kind to me ñ Sleepy days I have known some ñ Twisted followings have shown some ñ Ways to live ñ Different from the ways I prayed to die, Lord ñ To my friends a thank you song
She cut her face in the mirror last night ñ Trying to get through to another side ñ She says she doesn't understand men's pride ñ She says she can not stand her life ñ She's looking for any way out ñ I can't stand what she's thinking about ñ I want to tell her everything will be all right ñ But I love her too much, too much to lie ñ She's looking for any way out ñ I can't stand what she's thinking about ñ She's looking for any way out ñ I can't stand what she's thinking about
Nothing to hold on to when you're alone, then you find each other ñ She heard you're leaving in august ñ You promise to write, she's waiting at home ñ An unanswered call ñ I want you to know I'm alright and missing you ñ Too bad I'm stuck here with words from a note you sent long ago: ñ "I'd love you forever" ñ But I'll be back in november ñ I know that by then it will be the end
There's nothing left except the heat ñ You get stronger, I stay weak ñ I never charge for what I do ñ Because I gave it all to you ñ Swallow me ñ I dedicate myself to you ñ Swallow me ñ I'm ready for you ñ You make me shiver ñ I want more ñ That's the flavor I adore ñ I ended crawling all over you ñ Sweet and sweeter ñ Supercute ñ Swallow me
Nothing but sound ñ Nothing but slumber ñ Nothing but frenzy ñ Nothing but rush ñ Nothing but fever ñ Nothing but seconds ñ Choke on the fire - free for all times ñ Nothing but pure ñ Nothing but fragile ñ Nothing but human ñ Nothing but you ñ Nothing but grateful ñ Nothing but shameless ñ Choke on the fire - free for all times
This is a special core ñ Bodies creeping on the floor ñ And the rats are falling into regret again ñ Don't lose your restless power ñ Respect your masters glower ñ And the rats are falling into regret again ñ We fighting for the rest ñ The goverment shows herself impressed ñ And the rats are falling into regret again ñ Who's watching over you ñ Guardian angels out of view ñ And the rats are falling into regret again ñ So why can't we perfectly study ñ Danger danger ñ At last every queen has to run, buddy! ñ Danger danger
We do try our best to have all the lyrics you want, but sometimes the lyrics are just not submited to us yet ñ Do you have the lyrics? Why not submit them!
Reaching for the surface ñ I cannot feel it ñ My lungs they feel like bursting ñ Stop the pain ñ Conscious thoughts are fading ñ Fading quickly ñ Feed my fear of drowning ñ Darkness comes ñ Walking in cold sweat ñ Pulse is racing ñ Staring at the ceiling ñ Breathing fast ñ This nightmare keeps repeating ñ Becoming clearer ñ I'm finally realizing my end is near
You're lonely and I'm lonely, so why can't we be lonely together? ñ The night is young and while it grows older ñ We can't forget crying on each other's shoulder ñ The sky's cloudy 'cause we're lonely, but soon we'll see a change in the weather ñ Two lonely hearts beating as one, can be miserable and still have a lot of fun
Just friends ñ Lovers no more ñ Just friends ñ But not like before ñ To think of what we've been ñ And not to kiss again ñ Seems like pretending ñ It isn't the ending ñ Two friends ñ Drifting apart ñ Two friends ñ But one broken heart ñ We loved we laughed we cried ñ Then suddenly love died ñ The story ends ñ And we're ñ Just friends ñ We loved we laughed and we cried ñ Then suddenly love died ñ The story ends ñ And we're ñ Just friends
Will we get what we begun? ñ Looking after number one ñ Never feel you have enough ñ And you can't do nothing for it ñ You can't do nothing for it just... ñ Stop! ñ The voice inside your head ñ Don't leave me for dead to you ñ Dead to you ñ Dead ñ {Dead} You gonna cave in to your heart? ñ (Dead) Are we falling out of love? ñ (Dead) Another day, another ditch ñ (Dead) And you can't do nothing for it ñ Can't do nothing for it just... ñ Stop! ñ The voice inside your head ñ Don't leave me for dead to you ñ Dead to you ñ Dead

She buried herself in the air ñ Where? Up there ñ She scurried up invisible back stairs ñ Where?

I think I have lost my way ñ Like ruin my soul ñ Throwing away ñ Into a city not mine non yours ñ Do you remember? ñ And I was running ñ Every spring around the earth ñ To find a hope ñ To bring you the first rose ñ I saw you there first time ñ Do you remember? ñ You are missing a winter and seems for five ñ Do you remember? ñ And I was running ñ Every spring around the earth ñ To find a hope ñ To bring you the first rose ñ I saw you there first time ñ Do you remember? ñ You are missing a winter and seems for five ñ Do you remember?

Are you feeling well? ñ And are you alone, in the house we called our home ñ I'm still waiting here, lost and without a care ñ The further you run, the closer you are to me ñ Well, I'm still waiting here ñ Arms wide and wearing thin ñ You must be blinded by your own eyes ñ Surely you understand it's you I despise ñ And if we hold on to what we had ñ We could be what everyone has ñ Just to see the sun rise into the sky ñ I'd give anything to be closer to you ñ I'd give everything to be closer to you
Despises corpses ñ As soon as see them ñ In all rituals are defeated ñ He created this world for ñ His own amusement ñ Behind the curtain of the Heavenly ñ It's the land of pleasures ñ The weak will serves, and ñ The fool is devoured ñ Seeing them die ñ Abandon the game ñ Like a deadly puzzle ñ Arena for humanity to suffer ñ Typhoons roaring ñ Strength and rancor ñ Storms and gales ñ Furious Works of God ñ Paradise on Holocaust! Paradise ñ Paradise on Holocaust! Paradise
Feelings are so fragile ñ Egos are always blown ñ A ship in a bottle ñ Collapses under my cell phone ñ Your soft skin, unbroken sin ñ Next to my rough calluses ñ A mild kiss, sleep paralysis ñ Tell me more about your sister ñ  ñ Brittle bones ñ Hold my body together ñ Tender touches ñ Mend me with feathers

The anger that builds inside you ñ Presses against the walls ñ Never ceasing in your hatred ñ Can't conceive your life at all ñ Violent feuds explode in your wake ñ As you injure all who cross your path ñ You can't cope with changes 'round you ñ Hate just boils in your heart ñ Murder, Death, Wrath ñ Seem to be your only friends ñ Mind can't take the never ceasing hole ñ Collapse in heated hatred ñ Your wraith a steaming cole ñ It ends in your destruction

I heard a strong voice ñ Shout out my name ñ But when I turned around no one was there ñ It was just an illusion I had ñ That they should come back one day ñ Embrace yourselves! ñ Watch them collide with destiny ñ The sinner's hand ñ Strangles them, forever... ñ Arise, when the chance appears ñ The sinner's hand embraces them ñ And so, arise on the Trail of Tears ñ (I know) the sinners all rose ñ Persuation falls on the Trail of Tears ñ The sinners all rose
Yeah, you were scarred ñ And you were cryin' loud, right out in the schoolyard ñ And, yeah, I felt good ñ Everything I knew was looking just as it should ñ I saw the tree ñ Carved in it "666" and he found me ñ But I am no fool ñ I know every time I look in his eyes, he sees me too ñ Dry your eyes ñ I won't tell your mother ñ She won't ever discover ñ The things you kept under the covers ñ And please don't cry ñ I am not your brother ñ I am not your lover ñ And there is nothing wrong

In the jungle, the mighty jungle ñ The lion sleeps tonight ñ In the jungle, the quiet jungle ñ The lion sleeps tonight ñ Near the village, the peaceful village ñ The lion sleeps tonight ñ Near the village, the quiet village ñ The lion sleeps tonight ñ The lion sleeps tonight ñ Hush, my darling, don't fear, my darling ñ The lion sleeps tonight
You scratch the surface ñ I take the plunge ñ You say it's started ñ I say it's done ñ Is this another mountain? ñ Is this another wall? ñ Is this another precipice ñ For me to take a fall? ñ Should I call surrender? ñ Should I call to arms? ñ It's just another question ñ I can't resolve ñ I really need a savior ñ I need a shining star ñ I need someone bigger than this ñ To take hold of my heart ñ Redeem me ñ Redeem me ñ Redeem me ñ Redeem me
Send me the pillow that you dream on ñ Don't you know that I still care for you ñ Send me the pillow that you dream on ñ So darling I can dream on it too ñ Each night while I'm sleeping oh so lonely ñ I'll share your love in dreams that once were true ñ Send me the pillow that you dream on ñ So darling I can dream on it too ñ I've waited so long for you to write me ñ But memory all that's left of you ñ Send me the pillow that you dream on ñ So darling I can dream on it too ñ So darling I can dream on it too
Our bodies obscured by the sun ñ From our birth we are cursed ñ Inverted is the life we live ñ Under the pale gray sky ñ Bellow the shades ñ Of the dark clouds ñ Victory is drown in our eyes ñ A dawn of a new order we adore ñ The infernal prince we worship ñ The balance of life and death ñ The icy tough of existance ñ Spit out the fruits of madness ñ Expose your hate ñ Escape from weakness ñ Open your eyes and see ñ The veil has been lifted ñ The chain has been broken ñ Our reign has just begun...
Don't blame me for falling in love with you ñ I'm under your spell but how can I help it? ñ Don't blame me ñ Can't you see when you do the things you do? ñ If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling ñ Don't blame me ñ I can't help it if that doggoned ñ Moon above makes me need ñ Someone like you to love ñ Blame your kiss, as sweet as a kiss can be ñ And blame all your charms that melt in my arms ñ But don't blame me
Whenever I see you ñ I know my dreams are coming true ñ Every time I close my ñ Every time I close my eyes ñ I don't know what to do ñ My heart will always break in two ñ Every time I close my ñ Every time I close my eyes ñ I don't wanna be like everybody else ñ I don't wanna be stuck on another shelf ñ Whenever I see you ñ I know my dreams are coming true ñ Every time I close my ñ Every time I close my eyes
I dissociate the memory ñ Torn apart and depressive ñ Apathy ñ Loss of time ñ My whole being's a nightmare ñ I am scared ñ Who am I? ñ Knight errant ñ In armour ñ Alter ego ñ My wall ñ In a moment of shelter ñ I stumble and fall ñ I dissociate the memory ñ Temporary mental escape ñ From pain ñ Temporary mental escape ñ From fear ñ I'm losing touch ñ I dissociate the memory ñ I am going straight upstairs ñ To a room in my head ñ I am going straight upstairs ñ I just want to forget
Am I real ñ And what do I feel ñ Hate is half a heart ñ Only I am in my arms ñ You were sold ñ For something to hold ñ Nothing's as rude as the cold ñ Stupidly, beautifoolish, true you ñ Maybe madness is a heart ñ Maybe heaven is a habit ñ If I could fly ñ I'd live in the sky ñ I come from why ñ And obviously you do, too ñ The very start of everything hard ñ Could be the slip of a fingertip
Can't catch it again, can you? ñ Can't catch it again, can you? ñ I think I'm getting it back again ñ I think I'm getting it back again ñ I'm getting a headache ñ Mutated/Transmogrified ñ Mutated/Transmogrified
This has come to end ñ In moments these flowers will bloom and rot ñ In moments your beauty, laid to waste ñ Your convictions felt ñ Your convictions denied ñ Your convictions felt ñ Waiting as I saw you fading ñ Like everything in time you weathered and you died ñ Pull the pedals and rot ñ Dead eyes for false lies

As night falls, your words are ringing above all ñ And now the summer rain is gone ñ Pawn the photos on your wall ñ I'm standing in the same place that you left me ñ And I'll stay until you find your way back here again ñ Everything that I wish I could say to you fell between the skies we stare into ñ So promise me you'll tell me everything tonight ñ And if this ink ever runs dry maybe you'll fail and wonder why

I want to slip into the quiet ñ And let the whole world pass me by ñ I need a break from all of existence ñ So I can finally rest my eyes ñ I'd like to slip into the quiet (just to try it) ñ And watch the whole world pass me by ñ If I should take from my own existence ñ If I should stop it all just for an instant ñ Will I finally rest inside? ñ Is peace so hard to find? ñ Don't let me slip into the quiet ñ Don't let the whole world pass me by

Darkness descends upon the land to wrap the world in night's black embrace. The restless dead stir in their ancient tombs and creatures, born of shadow, rise to quench their savage hungers.

Save up, until you've had it ñ Your purse gone, but you won't go on ñ Brought down with a force of nature ñ Breathing off my lung ñ It's not easy to like it ñ It's not easy at all ñ It's not easy to like it at all ñ Fill up to the limit ñ Winter's come as an appetite ñ Money clips, equipped with paper ñ Pockets brimming and tight ñ It's not easy to like it ñ It's not easy at all ñ It's not easy to like it at all
Fucked and drank all night ñ Acted all alright ñ Had no need to fight ñ Tonight, tonight ñ Fucked and drank all night ñ Acted all alright ñ Had no need to fight ñ Tonight, tonight ñ  ñ  ñ Cast me far away ñ Play these little games ñ Actin' all okay ñ Today, today ñ Cast me far away ñ Play these little games ñ Actin' all okay ñ Today, today

Seven ships without a sail, seven cats without a tail ñ Boy, it's weird here on this spooky old pier tonight ñ But I'm not frightened 'cause I know what it is ñ Everything is just the same as it was ñ I'm in trouble because of Linda, she hurt me so badly ñ She said she'd be here on our special pier, I love her ñ Linda, the carousel's playing ñ But that merry-go-round is bringing me down ñ 'Cause I remember what it meant to you ñ Linda, Linda ñ I love you

Don't want no photograph to carry all the time ñ Don't want no story 'bout the times we used to have ñ You're all I think about, you're all that's on my mind ñ Don't wanna live without, you know it can't be right ñ Don't wanna hear your verse, don't call me on the phone ñ Don't wanna meet you out to say you're moving on ñ You're all I think about, you're all that's on my mind ñ Don't wanna live without, you know it can't be right ñ One, two, three, four ñ One, two, three, four

The way of the weekend ñ Is getting right to yah ñ And the city just deceived you ñ And then stared right at yah ñ And the way we learn ñ Its the way down on the weekend ñ That's taking control ñ I'm hollow but I'm heaving ñ Where did my week go? ñ And why do I feel cold ñ When I'm triggered to run? ñ And the way we are ñ Is taking control ñ And the way down on the weekend ñ Is getting right to yah ñ And the way down on the weekend ñ Is getting right to yah ñ And the way we are ñ Is taking control
My mind is burning but my heart is still beating ñ The smoke chokes your breath ñ A torch in the dark ñ I'm just a corpse of my kind ñ Blinded by the light ñ The fear of failure keeps haunting my dreams ñ Expressing my demons ñ Burning through faith ñ Perfect self destruction ñ It's time to bury the dead ñ In your life are you connected to yourself? ñ When you die will you be connected to yourself?
Endless lust for power of the aged politicians... ñ Corrupted rotten system, producing ass... ass leaders ñ Who's got the power?? ñ Who is a man who controls politics from behind?

The interruption went ñ Small snag in life ñ Pothole in the road ñ It's only a detour ñ A minor deterrent ñ That can't unload ñ My examination ñ Parts a to b ñ There is no cause ñ No cause at all ñ For my hesitation ñ Nothing indeed
There's a picture that I carry ñ One we made sometime ago ñ When they ask who's in the picture with me ñ I say, just someone I used to know ñ Just someone I used to spend some time with ñ Just a flame that's lost its glow ñ I don't tell them, how many nights I cry without you ñ I say, just someone I used to know ñ Just someone I used to run around with ñ Just a friend from long ago ñ But, I don't tell them, how lost I am without you ñ I say, just someone I used to know ñ I say, just someone I used to know

Everything around me shrinks and expands ñ Memories compacted ñ Fantasies extracted ñ Suspend me from the floor and push the ceiling nearer ñ This is just a reenactment of the thoughts projected from your eyes ñ The faces and names are not real ñ Only the tears, blood and glass are authentic ñ We link hands and dreams to become the map of the damned ñ Found a wound across my ribs, soft and fresh as a ballet shoe ñ To finger and feed ñ Memories flaccid ñ Fantasies reenacted ñ Finger and feed
I felt alive for the first time in years ñ The night I destroyed what was keeping me here ñ Ours were the hands that broke the chain with nothing to gain ñ  ñ For kids who hate each other ñ This is a good place to live ñ A clean stove and wood floors ñ A place that I would call home ñ  ñ And up my stairs I could tell that you're bored ñ Let go trashed floors, I wish I never came home ñ  ñ Pay my respects to last summer ñ "no pictures in the car" ñ I'm living in the past, I'm not living
You let me go - warmly ñ Turned my back - growing ñ And setting out - boldly ñ I'm making up for lost time ñ Coming home ñ And i swear it's true ñ I need you ñ So take me back - hoping ñ Abandon ship - learning ñ Drop my guns - open ñ Tear my core - broken ñ I'm making up for lost time ñ Coming home ñ Don't break my neck ñ Hold your own ñ Drink in deep ñ Cherish breath ñ Moving on ñ And i swear it's true ñ I need you ñ And you swear it's true ñ We're never through ñ Build this up - stronger ñ Hold you close - always
Ahhhh.. let's go! ñ I'm reeling from your stare ñ When you look from over there ñ Big boots and skin tight jeans ñ Sixty-four horny teens ñ (chorus) ñ Sweet Matilda, the school bus driver (x4) ñ I'm waiting at 7:15 ñ That's when you arrive, my queen ñ Pull up in a cloud of black smoke ñ Roll with me and laugh at my jokes ñ (chorus) ñ (repeat verses in opposite order) ñ (chorus x2)
Bring your best friend ñ There's enough of me, oh ñ Take it all in ñ Tel me what you wanna do ñ Ain't no tapping out, no ñ No baby ñ Take me places that I never been ñ I promise that I've been everywhere ñ Bust it open  ñ  for a pair ñ  ñ Would you ever ñ Make love on the dancefloor? ñ Mmm ñ Would you ever? ñ Mmm ñ Would you ever? ñ Live in the moment ñ Baby, , would you ever? ñ Make it back up in the morning ñ Ohh whoa ñ Mmm
Defeating decisions ñ Inflicting an absence in myself ñ Facing my fears ñ Striving for years ñ Motivations for existence ñ Still remain unclear ñ Ten million reasons ñ For all the fallen legions ñ Ten million reasons ñ I've led myself astray ñ (x2) ñ Cast out ñ Force down ñ Shut off ñ The fight for self control ñ Hiding behind ñ Your faceless design ñ Disconnect from this world ñ I'll feel okay in time
