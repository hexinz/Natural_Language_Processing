I hate it when you touch me ñ All your jealousy ñ You don't really know me ñ Damn I need something new ñ I'm sick of being your tool ñ Not my fantasy ñ I'm not your clown ñ I'm not your fool ñ Damn I need something new ñ Envy ñ Empty ñ Won't go to heaven for sure ñ Greedy ñ Jealousy ñ No place in heaven ñ It's full ñ Sentimental bullshit ñ Time to take a zip ñ I'm sick of being your prick ñ Damn I need something new
In the still of the night ñ As I gaze out of my window ñ At the moon in it's flight ñ My thoughts all stray, stray to you ñ In the still of the night ñ While the world lies in slumber ñ Oh the times without number ñ When I say to you ñ Do you love me ñ Just like I love you ñ Are you my life to be ñ That dream come true ñ Or will this dream of mine ñ Will it fade way out of sight ñ Just like that moon growing dim ñ Way out on the rim of the hill ñ In the still of the night
You better get in your bag (your bag) ñ You better get in your bag (your bag) ñ You better get in your bag (your bag) ñ Fuck what you hear, know you gotta get in you bag

Sweet October, everything comes down ñ And the ghosts outside are rattling the storms ñ And the drunkards think they're sober ñ And the lovers think they're drowning ñ And the songs of spring are bitter wings to them ñ A touch of snow, a sudden end to evenings ñ Dark falls on the daylight like a crow ñ Sweet October and the mountain roads are empty now ñ And I'm coming home ñ Sweet October, everything comes down ñ Copyright 1995, Hugh Blumenfeld / Hydrogen Jukebox Music
You hold the candle I once lit ñ You shine your light ñ When you forgive I cry ñ You run your fingers through my hair ñ And tell me it's worthwhile, it's all worthwhile ñ Even when I hate myself ñ Even when I feel your pain ñ When you cry ñ Even when my heart is cold ñ You assure me it's worthwhile, it's all worthwhile ñ You see, see what can't be seen ñ You repair the damage done to me
Growing up ñ Doing my best just to fill my cup ñ Waiting my turn, no one to lean on ñ Taking the pain as it comes ñ Everyone knows ñ That I've become numb ñ  ñ And some say ñ It's better this way ñ I find I feel saved ñ When are you coming home, my babe? ñ  ñ Have you seen ñ What just happened between you and me? ñ You got my pride and it burns ñ Even I can't fight ñ How I want to know you ñ  ñ And some say ñ It's better this way ñ I find I feel saved ñ When are you coming home, my babe?
We're turn around; around in circles, looking for an airshaft ñ The cynics told you it ceased to exist ñ Search inside your headache ñ Bring your comfort down on me ñ We'll fly around the world in a day ñ Around the world.... ñ We'll find our airshaft on our way ñ Bring you're comfort down on me
If I keep wandering around this house, I'll die ñ If I keep walking around this town, I'll die ñ So I fall or find something that lifts ñ And puts all the blood back into my veins ñ If I keep driving down this street, I'll die ñ If I keep talking about this mess, I'll die ñ So I fall or find something that lifts ñ And puts all of the love back into my veins

Me and you ñ Got nothing better to do ñ Than to push each other around ñ In our own way ñ I'm gonna divine it ñ I'm gonna figure out the cause ñ Why we're both riding up and down ñ On my emotional flaws ñ Dig a deep shaft ñ Fill it with grass ñ Catch the alien ships ñ When they're gonna pass ñ Nothing is sacred ñ But everything's clean ñ Watch the silly humanoids ñ Always stuck in between ñ Everyone's down ñ Lazy and slow ñ Everyone's down ñ Everyobody wants to know ñ Fully sketched out ñ But down inside ñ Still down inside

Time is slow ñ And the world gets cold ñ Sometimes I have regrets ñ But I ain't done yet ñ I'd do it ñ All over again ñ With the stars all closing in ñ I'd set out on the old ocean ñ I'd dream the same dreams ñ I'd do the same things ñ My friend ñ I'd do it all over again ñ All over again

Somebody's on my mind ñ Like an old sweet song, "The Lasting Time" ñ Somebody's on my mind ñ So I'm walking on clouds on a silver line ñ To dream my dream could be my mistake ñ But I'd rather be wrong ñ And sleep right along than wake ñ Love may be blind I'll take my chances ñ That it cares this affair, my real romance ñ That's why you'll find somebody's on my mind
I hate whore moms who dress all slutty and embarrass their children ñ I remember how it was when I was a kid and my mom would dress like a whore and embarrass me ñ Don't they have any respect? ñ Stupid Cunt
Platoon ñ Fall in! ñ Come on, you knuckleheads ñ Move it, move it, move it ñ Moss in the mornin', lets you in ñ Is it a field day, make me sin ñ It's only warm my, let you stay ñ Moss in the mornin', might be way ñ Chase! ñ Learned ñ Finely ñ Earn your ray ñ Might be they ñ Lucky day ñ No! ñ How could you ever moss it down ñ Extra ordin is not my sound ñ She better hope that you better mind ñ Mix me over my, let be wide!

I wouldn't take it from me ñ But maybe ñ We gotta do it this way ñ And find out ñ We gotta do it this way ñ Looks like you ñ Talks like you ñ Just a mirror, correction, idea ñ Reflection ñ  ñ Looks like you ñ Talks like you ñ Just a mirror, correction, idea ñ Reflection ñ  ñ Just getting closer, sin, faith. ñ  ñ Why did we do it this way? ñ  ñ Try to see, try to see - an eye!
Just friends, lovers no more ñ Just friends, but not like before ñ To think of what we've been and not to kiss again ñ Seems like pretending it isn't the ending ñ Two friends drifting apart ñ Two friends, but one broken heart ñ We loved, we laughed, we cried, and suddenly love died
As your loved ones they place ñ Heavy stones on your face ñ Your sonnets of life ñ They are filling the case ñ High windows inside me ñ Look down on your face ñ Changing white fingers ñ For men in the sand ñ Burning bright spears ñ That you hold in your hand ñ Grey children you've spawned ñ They just won't understand ñ As the slow pulse of sobbing ñ Dries-from the sky ñ My grief in red circles ñ Surrounding an eye ñ Grey child stands looking ñ And passes on by
How faces change like the seasons, and how I miss your spring ñ I tried to sleep through winter, but dead roses still have thorns ñ Up in flames you seemed to go, killed the love we'd yet to grow ñ You looked so good as you turned away ñ I never quite believed it until I saw you pull your eyes out ñ I watched you burn, and everytime I think about you, a piece of me dies with you ñ Throw the switch on my tired soul ñ What was pure has turned to stone ñ Throw the switch
How do you dream? How do you think? ñ How do you do everything? ñ If you're not like me and you're just like me ñ You are just like me ñ And what do you feel?

Where do you go? ñ Where do you go to get lost? ñ You know where I'll be 'cause you're just like me ñ You're just like me
Freak out ñ Don't you take the cop out ñ Chain reactor touch down ñ Take a drum and tie it down ñ Grinder ñ Pour it in and grind it ñ Put it through the grater ñ Use your hole to find it ñ Turn around ñ Freak out ñ Drop out ñ Go again ñ Goat ñ Echo ñ Low reverberation ñ Step it up sharp intake ñ Animal sensation ñ Discord ñ Shoot to hit brain melter ñ Heavy turbine crackle ñ Justify this shackle
Make the great escape ñ And find a way to make ends meet ñ Enemies ñ Well I don't think they ever sleep ñ Make our way until we see the light ñ Another day and it will be ñ Alright ñ So what you say ñ And what you do is who you are ñ You say it's truth ñ But still you lied right from the start ñ Make a change and find the reasons why ñ Another day, another chance and you will be ñ Alright ñ And I wonder ñ When we fall ñ Who do we need? ñ Who do we call? ñ Alright
Tempted and tried ñ We're oft made to wonder ñ Why could it be thus ñ All the day long ñ When there are others ñ Living about us ñ Never molested ñ Though in the wrong ñ Farther along ñ We'll know all about it ñ Farther along ñ We'll understand why ñ Cheer up my brother ñ Live in the sunshine ñ We'll understand it all ñ By and by ñ When death has come ñ And taken our loved ones ñ It's leaving our home ñ So lonely and drear ñ Then do we wonder ñ Why others prosper ñ Living so wicked ñ Year after year ñ Farther along ñ We'll know all about it
When I say you won ñ  ñ Yes I know, yes I know, yes I know what you are ñ Said I know

When the night has come ñ And the land is dark ñ And the moon is the only light we'll see ñ No, I won't be afraid ñ No, I won't be afraid ñ Just as long as you stand ñ Stand by me ñ So darling, darling ñ Stand by me ñ Oh, stand by me ñ Oh, stand ñ Stand by me ñ Stand by me ñ If the sky that we look upon ñ Should tumble and fall ñ Or the mountains should crumble to the sea ñ I won't cry, I won't cry ñ No, I won't shed a tear ñ Just as long as you stand ñ Stand by me
It starts in my belly, then up to my heart ñ Into my mouth, I can't keep it shut ñ Do you recognize the smell? ñ Is that how you tell us apart? ñ  ñ  ñ I fool myself to sleep and dream ñ Nobody's here, no one but me ñ So cool, you're hardly there ñ Why can't this be killing you? ñ  ñ  ñ Frankenstein would want your mind ñ Your lovely head, your lovely head ñ  ñ Your lovely head

It was overcast most of the way ñ Clouds thick with rain that couldn't pour ñ Something was building up in the water ñ Something was building up in the rain ñ We were only holding out for nothing, leaving it on bare ground.

This is a firsthand account ñ Of a culture committing suicide ñ The unraveling scream ñ Of the precious shared bonds ñ As we wrench free ñ Of their grip on our lives
I am my mother's only one ñ It's enough ñ I wear my garment so it shows ñ Now you know ñ  ñ Only love is all maroon ñ Gluey feathers on a flume ñ Sky is womb and she's the moon ñ  ñ I am my mother on the wall ñ With us all ñ I move in water, shore to shore ñ Nothing's more ñ  ñ Only love is all maroon ñ Lapping lakes like leery loons ñ Leaving rope burns, reddish rouge ñ  ñ  ñ Only love is all maroon ñ Gluey feathers on a flume ñ Sky is womb and she's the moon

It doesn't matter now, it never really did ñ They are all invisible, inconsequential ñ After all, that's life! ñ Or maybe an end to it ñ Oh, you are so perceptive ñ The world will be watching ñ With a curious eye ñ Taking notes and taking stock ñ Nerves will be fraying everywhere ñ Please take heed and take care ñ After all, that's life! ñ All over the world

Lyin' under a broken bridge ñ A heart, a mouth with nothing to give ñ You came, you saw, you draw ñ Out the evenin', out the evenin' ñ Thieves steal the mood you're in ñ You were just out wanderin' ñ The last soul of glass ñ From your past is back ñ Bury this ñ Your blood thins at this war within ñ By the soft night, while the lights, they dim ñ You lost the long goodbye ñ But you tried, but did you try? ñ Bury this
On a ruined wind ñ To see our promise right in front of you ñ Silver barbs to crash the heart ñ Those gates so irremovable ñ Oh we can beg, we will bend again ñ Oh we can beg that we will bend again ñ Up in thin air we lie in wait ñ Held to loose ñ Wait for the word to come and then to hell with you ñ Over the fire a time to bear what those below await ñ Here's my golden spear ñ Here's my cold despair ñ Up in thin air we lie in wait
Love to hear yourself ñ But we don't give a shit ñ About your simple minded rhetoric ñ Martyring bullshit wears thing ñ So high and mighty ñ You're so fucking boring

Genocide ñ Wrong side ñ Don't fall inside ñ Lost compromise ñ Who has lost ñ And what's the gain ñ Its causic cost ñ Is all the same ñ Time to savve ñ Your blessed race ñ Foolish bastard ñ Born ignorant ñ Who has lost ñ And what's to gain ñ Its caustic cost ñ Is all the same ñ Follow the leaders ñ Of mindless games ñ Ignorance rules in stupid ways

Lyrics From Snippet ñ Don't you know I love you? ñ Baby, don't you know I love you?
Will you still love me in December? ñ I could sleep many days, and it ñ Wouldn't make a difference ñ Without you ñ Without you ñ Seems I have forgotten it all ñ What was to forget ñ So you finally said I could leave, but I ñ Didn't want to leave then ñ Without you ñ Without you ñ Will you still love me in December? ñ I could sleep many days, and it ñ Wouldn't make a difference ñ Without you ñ Without you

I don't know just how it happened ñ I let down my guard ñ Swore I'd never fall in love again, but I fell hard ñ Guess I should have seen it coming, caught me by surprise ñ I wasn't looking where I was going and I fell into your eyes ñ  ñ You came into my crazy world ñ Like a cool and cleansing rain ñ Before I knew what hit me, baby ñ You were flowing through my veins ñ  ñ I'm addicted to you
I've got a, girl rushing in, my head ñ Hopeless lover ñ I've gotta learn to drop her, or else... ñ  ñ In life, there is ñ A moment when you see it in a scene, of film ñ Between the lines, an actress shows up without any warn ñ Or sign ñ  ñ  ñ She took, my sanity ñ With one glance I was stunted for the next, two weeks ñ And when she smiled, I melted like a snowflake in my hand ñ (hand) (Ooh) ñ  ñ  ñ Now I've lost my sense of drive ñ Awake, all, night ñ Nothing but the girl in sight ñ Lost my, mind
Ah yes ñ Ooh lord ñ Yes sir ñ (?) ñ Yes lord ñ (?) ñ (?) ñ We 'bout to get into some grown folk shit right here ñ Ain't nobody playing no games ñ (?) ñ It's getting real out here in the field ñ It's been real ñ Gotta stand up for my black people ñ Grown folk (?) ñ Come get in where you fit in ñ Shout out to (?) ñ (?)
I need you baby, both night and day ñ When I sent for you baby, you turn, and go the other way ñ Yes I need you, yes I need you, both night and day ñ  ñ You cheated on me baby, all through the day ñ When I sent for you baby, you turn, you turn and go the other way ñ Yes I need you, yes I need you, both night and day ñ  ñ  ñ Yeah, I sent you money baby, to come on home to me ñ You tell me that, things ain't what they used to be ñ I need you baby, I love you darlin', come on home to me
Feel the message, hear the voices, hear them loud and clear ñ The higher orders affect your choices, injecting you with fear
Hope you got a fuckin' headache ñ Hope you got it good ñ Hope you got a fuckin' headache ñ 'Cos I always knew you should
Help me through the day, help me through the night ñ Baby your sweet loving will make everything all right ñ Help me through tomorrow when stormy weather comes ñ Lord make me realise that you're my woman ñ I can see so much pain deep inside your eyes ñ I know the feeling someone hurts you when someone makes you cry ñ Help me through the day, help me through the night ñ Babe you make me realise you're my woman ñ Help me through the day and be my woman ñ Help me through the night and be my woman
When I survey the wondrous cross ñ On which the Prince of glory died ñ My richest gain I count but loss ñ And pour contempt on all my pride ñ See from His head, His hands, His feet ñ So much sorrow and love flow mingled down ñ Did e'er such love and sorrow meet ñ Or thorns compose so rich, so rich a crown ñ Were this whole realm of nature mine ñ That were a present far too small ñ Love so amazing, so divine ñ Demands my soul, my life, my all ñ My life, my soul, my all
Arm in arm ñ Soul in soul ñ Floating on velvet sunsets of Sundays ñ  ñ Arm in arm ñ Soul in soul ñ Floating on velvet sunsets of Sundays
Take this in stride ñ W'll let them offer up their minds ñ As we carry on ñ We've made our choice ñ This crowd will sing with just one voice ñ Angels sing along ñ We find out strength in you ñ We know what pulls us through ñ But it's just not the way that we thought it would be ñ We draw the lines ñ Between the end and where we lie ñ Tell me what went wrong ñ Grey fades to black ñ We're headed the wrong way down a one way track ñ With one way back
Painless ghosts ñ Of which she knows ñ The smell in her clothes ñ The smell in her nose ñ There's blood on the snow ñ Bring your love ñ It's on your tongue ñ It's on your roads ñ And in your toes ñ There's blood on the snow ñ Tuesday's violence ñ We're alone ñ Into their beds they approach their doom ñ Their heads, their lips, their chests, their hips, they walk ñ Them bones they move, they talk ñ Their bones they bleed they rot ñ Their tones they're forged, they're wrought ñ Into what they're not
Your the type of dude be all on tv flossing ñ Plenty chicks keep calling
Little bells tinkle like wind chimes ñ  *Cantonese*  ñ Little bells tinkle like wind chimes ñ Little bells tinkle like wind chimes ñ  *Cantonese*  ñ Little bells tinkle like wind chimes ñ Little bells tinkle like wind chimes ñ Little bells tinkle like wind chimes ñ Little bells tinkle like wind chimes
A simple test. Probing loss. Looking for a vein ñ Tapping on a grave they call their own ñ I desire. I invite this process. Injection begin ñ Begin. Break the skin. Salvation quickly driven in ñ Pride in fracture. In subjection ñ A new supply running red with purpose ñ Nothing less than flawless in design ñ Systematic in possession. Igniting all within ñ Running red with purpose ñ Nothing less than flawless in design
In the days of my youth, I will remember my God.Enjoy your life while you are still young.But remember God will judge you for what you have done.Not long ago you had a fire that burned so bright.But now it seems it's all but gone out inside.You've lost your vigor, you lost your will to fight.You had a reason to start this war.Now there's a problem.You forgot what you're fighting for.You're giving up.You've lost direction.With no direction, you're just another old man.I'll never be an old man
I've never met her, and I don't mind ñ I've seen her face a thousand times ñ She hides behind her hair ñ And I wonder if her love is like mine ñ Face up, I'll face the day ñ Three weeks, you flew away ñ I'll never blame her ñ I'll never let you make me hate a girl that way ñ Touchdown, I hear you scored ñ I heard you slide out through the back door ñ I've never met her ñ But when I do, I'll thank her for saving me from you ñ Thank her for saving me from you
Sing the anthem ñ A song of the dead ñ Sing the love song ñ That rots in your head ñ Find the answer ñ Don't ever look back ñ There's blood to splatter ñ And skulls to crack ñ Sing the anthem ñ Of the underworld ñ Sing the love song ñ For the ugly girls ñ Pray you'll always ñ Be a fucked up kid ñ So pledge allegiance ñ To the blood and shit
I know you're different from the boys who went to school ñ Once again you've reached the point where you could ñ Walk into the road ñ (Oh) you've got the most to gain ñ (Oh) you would do anyway ñ The most to gain, (oh) ñ I fear your shape must be proportional to grace once again ñ The one to turn to is the one with most to gain

White lines ñ Of life and lies ñ Trigger me up ñ Until the day I die ñ Too soon, too much, too far ñ Coagulation for my deepest scar ñ Another line ñ Just to boost my high ñ Sub zero tolerance ñ I'm in denial  ñ Feed me ñ Another line ñ Kill me ñ Just one more time ñ Give me ñ Just one reason to live ñ Is this ñ Not the season to kill ñ An adrenalin rush ñ For my darkest fear ñ As I touch the sky ñ I know the end is here

You and I have come so far ñ You and I are like a star ñ Brighter than the sun ñ But hidden in the depths of our illusion ñ I wanna feel the ocean underneath my waves ñ From the sky of my emotion ñ Reaching up to you inside the moon of my imagination ñ You and I know this lie ñ You and I have come to die ñ So won't you feel the ocean underneath my waves ñ And from the sky of my emotion ñ I'll reach up to you inside your moon

Let me out! ñ Hey!
Axe chops your head ñ Knife carves you flesh ñ Face is bashed in ñ Gutted and skinned ñ Teeth are torn out ñ Fingers cut off ñ Eyes are punctured ñ Brains are splattered

Do you still want me dead ñ Like you used to do ñ Baby, said you'd dance on my grave ñ Just to make me blue ñ  ñ But I gotta thank for you're the reason I turned to stone ñ Yeah I gotta thank you boy when I see you feel my heart go ñ  ñ And I can't lie no I can't lie you're stuck in my head ñ And my bed remembers your skin ñ And I can't help it, you're all that I want and you're all that I hate ñ And when I see you I forgive you and we start again ñ Stargazing, replacing gold with rain ñ  ñ My heart goes
All I do the whole night through ñ Is dream of you ñ With the dawn I still go on ñ Dreamin' of you ñ You're every thought, you're everything ñ You're every song I ever sing ñ Summer, winter, autumn, and spring ñ Were there more than 24 hours a day ñ They'd be spent in sweet content dreamin' away ñ Sky's are gray!

Wait, I'm catching up, we left the casino at 3 o'clock ñ And the weathers always nicer, but I'm lying to myself I'm broke ñ I really need to talk to you, but we can never tell the truth ñ And it's just complicated doesn't mean that much to me ñ And we know that were just hanging on ñ To half thought out ideas, I don't know ñ I'd rather sit at home, then go to the show ñ I am tired I am boring, I have so much left to do ñ But no motivation, I'm just happy to be

I'm so glad that you're here with me ñ At the end of all things ñ I will not be afraid ñ Though skies have turned to gray ñ Or rain fall ñ And I will not be afraid ñ Though swift sun rise ñ And all will turn to silver glass ñ And all will turn to silver glass ñ There's still good left inside this world ñ And it's still worth fighting for ñ It seems so strange ñ These tiny things could rule our fate ñ I will not be afraid ñ Of a swift sunrise ñ And all will turn to silver glass ñ And all will turn to silver glass

Long years ago, on a deep winter night ñ High in the heavens, a star shone bright ñ While in the manger, a wee baby lay ñ Sweetly asleep, on a bed of hay ñ Jesus our lord, was that baby so small ñ Lay down to sleep, in a humble stall ñ Then came the star, and it stood over head ñ Shedding its light, 'round his little head ñ Dear baby Jesus, how tiny thou art ñ I'll make a place, for thee in my heart ñ And when the stars, in the heavens I see ñ Ever and always, I'd think of thee...

TAMIA LYRICS
Into the night ñ You fled ñ Betrayed me ñ Your hollow heart ñ And luring stare ñ My blood ñ Ran cold ñ Then I heard him - ñ From far away ñ A lullaby ñ CHORUS ñ Out of my deep despair ñ My lover sang a melody ñ He sent a ray of light to me ñ And saved me from the darkness ñ 'cause when I heard his voice ñ It sparked a distant memory - ñ A savior calling out to me ñ To set me free ñ How could it be ñ The face of an angel ñ Could drag me down ñ And leave me blind ñ CHORUS ñ I know ñ My heart, though weary ñ Must rise again ñ And come to you
You are holy ñ You are righteous ñ Your name is above all names ñ You're my healer ñ My deliverable ñ And you reign for always ñ I will bow in worship of you ñ I will sing of all your graces ñ Great is the lord ñ Great is the lord ñ Your kingdom will reign ñ Every knee will bow ñ And tongue confess ñ Great is the lord ñ Jesus you alone are worthy...

Speak of the son. No father brings the holy one ñ From cloven hoofs to claws to thorns, his rise to power has begun ñ Among your thieves, there lays another dying mouth to feed ñ Another filthy beast, your savior lives on wounded knees ñ Behold a rosy ring ñ A kingdom of shit breeds afflicted kings ñ A messiah of elbows and knees ñ I will spread the infection immaculately
Falling from her braided hair ñ New Morning on the stereo ñ Close together on the page ñ We live it down ñ She has made place for me ñ And life for those our children ñ Sewn into her Swedish purse ñ I think upon these things ñ Chosen by candlelight ñ As great trees have fallen ñ Quietly and to herself ñ This is my language ñ  ñ Again I am away at sea ñ Looked upon with sharp eyes ñ Father, how far am I? ñ It seems forever as the crow flies ñ Again I am away at sea ñ Tossed about under a mean sky ñ Lord, how far am I? ñ How far am I?
When will I know that it is gone? ñ Life sucked away... ñ Is is when the wheels go whizzing off like spinning tops ñ Violently whirling ñ Violently turning 'til they drop? ñ I've spent the days unsure ñ But should I spend them ñ Prepping for long goodbyes ñ And teary eyes or flip the coin and revitalize? ñ Have patience until November... ñ So I'm told I need answers! ñ I'm trusting who? ñ Metal Pig
Fingernails ñ Riding boots ñ Jalapeno pepper ñ Kitchen floor ñ Show me what $250 means
My heart fell out of the ugly tree ñ (We're talking about 500 miles of bad road) ñ My heart fell out of the ugly tree ñ And hit every branch on the way down

On terrible wings ñ No change in the weather ñ No stopping the weary sun ñ On chloroform days ñ I'll drive them together ñ I'll fly nearly on ñ I started to feel ñ Against all direction ñ I started to hear them sing ñ It's further away ñ But I know what you mean now ñ No distance between us here
I creep down alleys and peep thru blinds, I strangle and kill any children I find ñ I like meeting people when they're dead, I take some of them back to bed ñ I'm a maniac, I'm an insaniac, I'm a maniac, are you a maniac too? ñ Catching, eating spiders and flies, seducing people on telephone lines ñ I like little girls of nine or ten, I love making love to them ñ Setting light to dogs and cats, breaking into old ladies flats ñ Why is everyone laughing at me? Why is everyone laughing at me?

The cardinal at the window bravely seeking home ñ Yearning, wings are beating tiny heart alone ñ Aching for the reasons, earthbound heart and soul ñ Yearning is unanswered, learning life grows old ñ Truth is like a shadow, shadows growing long ñ The cause it stems from knowing the cause is growing strong ñ Aching for the reasons a willing struggle sworn ñ Choices made of living, voices heed unborn

We see, don't we, all that we experience is understandable as a spectrum of vibrations ñ There are different kinds of spectrums: there is a spectrum of light, there's a spectrum of sound ñ We can also think of spectrum of smells, of tactile feelings, of emotions ñ And so on all down the line, we are as if we're living in the midst of a woven tapestry of many dimensions ñ In which the warps and the loops are all these different spectra; various kinds of vibrations

A Bright winter ñ Could be killed ñ By your spears? ñ Take off your sweetest dress ñ Lift off your darkest breast ñ Til all smears ñ Girl guilt ñ I can't mother your fears ñ My gifts will burn ñ Waiting for you
Doesn't love lose some of its meaning ñ when it turns to hate with the flip of a switch? ñ Isn't real love supposed to have some semblance of fortitude?
Why should I worry, why should I fret ñ Look at all the ways He's made ñ And every promise kept ñ I look to the hills from which cometh my help ñ  ñ I'll tell you where my help cometh ñ Tell you where my help cometh ñ Tell you where my help cometh ñ It cometh from the Lord ñ  ñ Jesus is my help ñ Jesus is my help ñ Jesus is my help ñ Jesus is my help, my help
And I, I feel ñ Feel like, feel like ñ Feel like I'm gone ñ Feel like I'm goin' home ñ Take it down to my soul ñ Lay it back, feel so good ñ Summer sun turns me on ñ Lay me back, feels so good

When you move in right up close to me ñ That's when I get the shakes all over me ñ Quivers down my backbone ñ I got the shakes in the knee bones ñ Shivers down my thigh bones ñ Like I'm ñ Shakin' all over ñ That's what happens when you say goodnight to me ñ Bring this feeling all inside of me ñ Quivers down my backbone ñ I got the shakes in the knee bones ñ Shivers in the thigh bones ñ Like I'm ñ Shakin' all over
And all this chaos that I've preferred ñ And all the liars I have heard ñ And all the singers that have sung ñ And all the feelings which are fun ñ And unlike the other people ñ And unlike the final truth ñ And unlike the bossy figure ñ And the unlimited youth ñ And a story presented in its eyes ñ Is completely and totally organized ñ And existence in its final lines ñ And sleepy brains of our lives
Sorry ñ But I can't bear to be in the same room ñ With you ñ Longer than necessary ñ You can still drag me under ñ With a sneer ñ Or a smile ñ Politeness just exhausts me ñ Would you like to see me flaggin' ñ Wave the chequered one ñ Here comes the finishing line ñ It's no good for an iron heart ñ With a cynical halo ñ Supposed good times ñ When again? ñ Oops I forgot them ñ Perhaps right here right now ñ Would you like a little humiliation ñ Come to think of it ñ What was your name again baby? ñ You know what I mean
Dreaming again ñ Warm in your arms ñ Sing me a song ñ Beautiful sound ñ And you love me ñ With your sleepy eyes ñ But you're not around ñ I'm riding a ghost ñ You're already gone ñ And I wake up to a cold day ñ Just another in a long line of cold days ñ Clear as a bell ñ There in my bed ñ Holding your hands ñ Beautiful hands ñ And you love me ñ With your sleepy eyes ñ But you're just a dream ñ I'm walking alone ñ And I should have known ñ You'd find another soul mate ñ I'm just another in a long line of soul mates
Tell it to the starfish ñ Tell it to the souls ñ Tell it to the stranger ñ That everybody knows ñ Turn this lesson of silence ñ Her eyes, her eyes are upon you now ñ Her tears will flow upon you now ñ So ñ Tell it to the starfish ñ You solved beauty ñ You saw beauty ñ Tell it to the starfish ñ Tell it to the ghosts ñ Tell it to the enemy ñ Taking your control ñ Her eyes, her eyes are upon you now ñ "You sold your name"
Eyebrows removed one by one ñ Shoulder backs severed ñ Retribution's begun ñ Filet of breast ñ Your tits are hacked off ñ Hands to elbows disembodied ñ Stumps spurting blood ñ Death-blow to the heart ñ Head chopped clean off ñ Blood spewing from the gaping hole ñ Hands removed from the lone forearms ñ Arms and feet transformed to holes ñ Legs cut off - torso remains ñ Slowly dismembered from head to foot ñ Punishment served - mutilated corpse ñ (D.C.) ñ (E.C.)
Brazil, where hearts were entertaining June ñ We stood beneath an amber moon ñ And softly murmured "someday soon." ñ Brazil, where hearts were entertaining June ñ We stood beneath an amber moon ñ And softly murmured "someday soon." ñ We kissed and clung together ñ Then, tomorrow was another day ñ The morning found me miles away ñ With still a million things to say; ñ Now, when twilight dims the sky above ñ Recalling thrills of our love ñ There's one thing I'm certain of ñ Return I will to old Brazil

Life passes, as I am mortal ñ Time is not left eternally ñ Your erotic spirit and entire beauty ñ Makes my self believing in an ungod ñ Doom Like Lady ñ Doom Like Lady - ñ I need you ñ I can't express myself ñ Can't make the people see and believe in me ñ And then I dream of you and begin to see ñ That life is not worth human brutality ñ Doom Like Lady ñ Doom Like Lady - ñ I need you ñ In my soul I feel an eternal ache ñ When will we finally awake?
They made their promises ñ Then they walked away ñ Fair-weather friends ñ Are gone for good ñ You never cared about ñ What others had to say ñ And through it all ñ You understood ñ You are my prayer in times of trouble ñ I'll be your answer when you call ñ Shelter you, shelter me ñ Wake up, but keep dreaming ñ That you were born to fly ñ When your heart is heavy ñ Like a stone ñ I'll lift your burden high ñ Until you realize ñ That through the storm ñ You soldiered on ñ You showed me that your actions ñ Speak louder than your words

Mortals toil in pain ñ Love loses thunder ñ Well I'm beginning to wonder ñ If life betrays it gets in our way ñ Let's try forever on ñ Keep it simple and love ñ The serpents mortal sting ñ The wrath of Heavens thunder ñ Well I walk the streets to wonder ñ If life betrays it gets in our way ñ Let's try forever on ñ Keep it simple and love ñ Of mice and mortal men ñ A vice to watch her plunder ñ Well I'm beginning to wonder ñ If life betrays it gets in our way ñ Let's try forever on ñ Keep it simple and love
Put on your coat and button your pride ñ Take a deep breath and step outside ñ Hide your hope tightly inside your fist- ñ To scared to think ya know you can't resist ñ When a victory is sure ñ You're not afraid to stir ñ Plenty of yells to go around ñ The other side is strong ñ You might do something wrong ñ (Then) nobody wants to make a sound ñ ((Giving it all away. - 2x) Giving it all ñ Of what you own. - 2x)
So you wonder how ñ Get 'em up, put 'em up ñ Get your dukes up now ñ Got no time no money, that's why ñ Get 'em up, put 'em up ñ Get your dukes up now ñ  ñ Soda fountain crowd ñ Button up, shut 'em up ñ Gettin' fed up now ñ Got no time, no money, knock out ñ Get 'em up, put 'em up ñ Get your dukes up, now
You're on your own this time ñ This time you're on your own ñ I can't believe I let you do this to me(us) ñ Taken advantage of forced "I love you" ñ And broken goodbyes ñ Love is such a game to you ñ Love is such a game ñ One more time for love ñ One more time for our memory ñ One more time for love ñ One more time for us ñ Everything I touch falls to pieces
I'm standing alone in the rain ñ Facing the fear within ñ Inside nothing but pain ñ Whispering those words ñ Once again inside nothing but ñ Endless dark ñ Never forever senses make ñ The love crimes ñ Never forever bloody tears ñ For a blind man ñ Never ending love becomes blaze ñ Emotions rape my body ñ Once again lies bleeding at your feet ñ Inside nothing but endless dark
People-watching is one of my ñ Favourite things to help pass the time ñ They're all making a deal out of nothing ñ Decisions to be made, it seems so easy ñ And they're reading into things without my say-so ñ And he's sniffing his way to the top ñ Because the impression he gave was good ñ And so he stopped, and he stopped to shake my hand ñ With a smile but I knew he was in denial ñ Deer-hunting for ideas
Hear the holy roar of God resound ñ Watch the waters part before us now ñ Come and see what He has done for us ñ Tell the world of His great love ñ Our God is a God who saves ñ Our God is a God who saves ñ Let God arise ñ Let God arise ñ Our God reigns now and forever ñ He reigns now and forever ñ His enemies will run for sure ñ The church will stand, she will endure ñ He holds the keys of life, our Lord ñ Death has no sting, no final word

You're making this hard for me ñ I'm cleaning the mess I'm in ñ Please don'y pretend ñ 'Coz you're just the same like me ñ Like me ñ What did those angry stares mean? ñ I don't understand ñ You told me that I've change,no ñ But I haven't ñ And you're still here ñ In my heart ñ Since you've been gone ñ I always think about you ñ Now you're back ñ I don't know what to do ñ I know we can never be ñ You're still here ñ And I know it ñ And I know it ñ But I don't want to ñ And I know it ñ And I know it ñ But I don't want to believe

Lyrics from Snippet ñ When you worked hard at your hip ñ I leaved and took off and got a deal ñ I teach my niggas what I'm taught and now they label me a boss ñ They keep it real, and that's real ñ I post wheel, I'm so trill ñ My niggas act hard, I leave 'em roadkill ñ My family run, I need some more meals ñ Top off of the Don, I give her soul a thrill

Moon river, wider than a mile ñ I'm crossing you in style some day ñ Oh dream maker, you heart breaker ñ Wherever you're going I'm going your way ñ Two drifters off to see the world ñ There's such a lot of world to see ñ We're after the same rainbow's end ñ Waiting 'round the bend ñ My huckleberry friend ñ Moon river and me
It's hard to believe the end has come. I won't say I'm not apprehensive about telling you everything. This will be my work. I've condemned myself. Let's not flatter ourselves - We're only as good as our trends permit. I've been so fucking critical. Tell me who hasn't. You have no idea what you were to me. Now you've left these shoes to fill, and they're so stiff. It's hard to start anew
Right, okay, right, okay... ñ Here we go: ñ Hello to all side 2 listeners, this is John, Bernie and Thunderstruck from the Tempsons, combusting spontaneously
Didn't your momma tell you not to mess with them aliens? ñ I'm just trynna mate like a fuckin' Australian ñ Dreams of fuckin' Ms. Sarah Palin ñ And don't McCain look like his heart about to fail him? ñ But scratch that shit, Young Money, we the greatest ñ Add another check to my checkings and savings ñ Add four F's to the Weezy F. Baby ñ Now I'm Weezy Fuckin' Fuckin' Fuckin' Fuckin' Fuckin' Baby
The party was B.Y.O ñ So I B.M.O ñ I want to get loose ñ And have some fun ñ I want to put on a record ñ And turn it up loud ñ And dance all night ñ When her parents are out of town ñ Her parents came home ñ And they were pissed ñ Your mother says ñ I'm not right for you ñ Your father says ñ I'm not right for you ñ But I say ñ I'm perfect for you
And then the fighting takes over ñ And I regret what I say ñ And whether or not there's other joy in laughter ñ That's taken far away ñ And as two souls rush together ñ I look again into your eyes ñ But we were just a pair of little children ñ Two children, no surprise ñ I fold you up into a corner ñ Can't fly away from me again ñ I think about the first time and lately ñ Oh, lately I think again
If I ever lose my way ñ I pray you'll pull me back someday ñ If I ever lose my cool ñ I pray your words will set me straight ñ If I ever raise my voice ñ I hope it's to proclaim your glory ñ I won't ever turn away ñ 'Cause I'm justified by Grace ñ So I'm gonna stay on this right path ñ Gonna travel holy ground ñ So I'm gonna stay on this right path ñ Gonna travel holy ground ñ I lift my voice up loud
A good friend is hard to find ñ But you'll have one if you open your eyes ñ A good friend is hard to find ñ I found you ñ Will you be mine? ñ And time will show ñ And time will SHOW ñ And time will show ñ And time will SHOW ñ A good friend is hard to find ñ But you'll have one if you open your eyes ñ A good friend is hard to find ñ I found you ñ Will you be mine? ñ And time will show ñ And time will SHOW ñ And time will show ñ And time will SHOW ñ But not me
If this world survives ñ And every other day I think it might ñ In good part it will be ñ Because of the great souls in our community ñ There are a lot of them ñ I've seen them walk ñ In lonely thousands down the city streets ñ Or stand in vigils in the rain ñ Or turn the handle of a print machine ñ Or empty their purses as the plate comes by ñ Or gaze into the camera's eye ñ And answer the question: "Will the world survive?" ñ And they have said ñ "We'll try. We'll try."
If ñ You ñ Want ñ To ñ Stay ñ That is what you want ñ We can make it work ñ But if you want to leave ñ I can say goodbye ñ Never hold it back ñ Simple silence seems to hold me down with you ñ You don't have to say anything ñ You don't even have to look anymore ñ And handshakes are supposed to be good ñ But handshakes are never good enough
If I put rubber in your head ñ Would you make something that time will stand ñ I've tried painting on the walls ñ But I've done nothing that stands alone ñ If I put rubber in your skin ñ Would you move around and rub it in ñ I've tried painting from the inside out ñ But I've done nothing that I can shout about ñ Should I give in ñ If I put rubber in your hand ñ Would you make me into a man ñ Put me on a chain and change my name ñ And lead me to the place that I need to go ñ Ah, yes, I give in
Steady giving me them lies, what you doing? ñ Why he have to play with my emotions ñ Told me he was with the guys, when I'm knowing ñ He linked up with Keisha from the low end ñ Why do all the faithful girls, get cheated on? ñ Get treated wrong?  Yeah, yeahh ñ That's that type of shit that'll drive you crazy ñ Crazy, crazy ñ Pull up to the crib, grab my 9, walk out the door ñ I'm gonna do me a drill tonight ñ Fuck he thought, forget what's right ñ Talk about pain well I feel yours, so you'll feel mine
Your picture ñ Is still ñ On my wall ñ On my wall ñ The colors ñ Are bright ñ Bright ñ As ever ñ Red is strong ñ Blue is true ñ Some things last a long time ñ Some things last a long time
(Incomplete lyrics) ñ Challenge me foolish
Going through a warzone every day ñ All these people getting in my way ñ Gonna mow the whole human race down ñ Run all these people into the ground ñ I'm a GI ñ World war 1 was just for fun ñ Mom and dad sent all their sons ñ World war 2's for someone's cause ñ World war 3 will have no laws
I'm so Glad,I'm so Glad ñ I'm Glad I'm Glad,I'm Glad ñ I'm so Glad I'm so Glad ñ I'm Glad I'm Glad I'm Glad ñ Don't know what to do, I don't know what to do ñ I don't know what to do ñ Tired of Weepin, Tired of Moanin ñ I'm Tired of Groaning for you ñ I'm so Glad I'm so Glad ñ I'm Glad I'm Glad i'm Glad ñ I'm so Glad I'm so Glad ñ I'm Glad i'm Glad I'm Glad ñ Guitar Solo ñ I'm so Glad I'm so Glad ñ I'm Glad i'm Glad I'm Glad ñ I'm so Glad i'm so Glad ñ I'm Glad I'm Glad i'm Glad
Respect... ñ Respect what is found ñ Respect should abound ñ Respect everything that you leave ñ I can't believe ñ Can't believe ñ Can't believe ñ  ñ And I, I can't believe ñ I can't believe all the travesty surrounding me ñ I want to flee ñ Well, I want to flee from everything In front of me ñ  ñ I can't believe ñ Can't believe ñ Can't believe ñ  ñ Never again, trusted in you ñ Fuck everything that you think I should be ñ I stand ñ Never again, never again ñ  ñ I can't believe ñ Can't believe ñ Can't believe ñ Can't believe ñ Can't believe
The lyrics for this song have yet to be transcribed
This moment changes everything ñ The course of blood within your veins ñ A stranger's form, your skeleton ñ See the bones glow as they break free ñ  ñ This moment changes everything ñ This moment, change is everything ñ Oh, oh! ñ  ñ This moment changes everything ñ The course of blood within your veins ñ A stranger's form, your skeleton ñ See the bones glow as they break free ñ  ñ This moment changes everything ñ This moment, change is everything ñ Oh, oh! ñ  ñ This moment changes everything ñ See the bones glow as they break free
Lately I've been thinking that I cleared a whole side of my room for you ñ Because your presence should be framed when your visits arrive ñ They are white and glowing so bright ñ I sit staring at my bedroom floor thinking I must be the only for
You're well nigh ñ Knowing a borrowed, brazen cry ñ Better hide ñ Lightly tried ñ Knowing eyes ñ Of passersby ñ Gaze into mine ñ We lightly tried ñ Knowing eyes ñ Of passersby ñ Gaze into mine ñ We lightly tried
I love being angry ñ (Screams) ñ Huh ñ I love being angry ñ Its my heroin ñ Infected with gangrene
It's the darkest time of year ñ Crystal branches everywhere ñ As the colours drain away ñ You alone are far away ñ Leaves of frost upon the trees ñ Lovers falling on their knees ñ Curtains parting in the night ñ Let me in your sweet delight ñ Where the garden used to be ñ Now a different world I see ñ For one second all I know ñ Everything is made of snow ñ First from white and then to blue ñ Pink to purple lost to view ñ It's the darkest time of year ñ Winter love is almost here
Take a little and leave a lot ñ I'm in control calling the shots ñ It's coming down from the sky ñ Appointed unto man once to die ñ I have no world but the one to come ñ I am a loner what have i done ñ I won't leave 'till i've shown you right ñ Attack i may i love to fight ñ I'm being caught away ñ You rapture my soul ñ I'm being caught away ñ Life will take it's toll ñ I'm only passing through what they call life ñ I'll get it with or without pain and strife ñ He suffered once, i will too ñ I just hate to leave without you

I've tried and tried to run and hide ñ To find a life that's new ñ But wherever I go I always know ñ I can't escape from you ñ A jug of wine to numb my mind ñ But what good does it do? ñ The jug runs dry and still I cry ñ I can't escape from you ñ These wasted years are souvenirs of love ñ I thought was true ñ Your memory is chained to me ñ I can't escape from you ñ There is no end, I can't pretend ñ That dreams will soon come true ñ A slave too long to a heart of stone ñ I can't escape from you
Not much to look at, nothing to see ñ Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be ñ I've got a man crazy for me ñ He's funny that way ñ I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent ñ He doesn't holler, he'd live in a tent ñ I've got a man crazy for me ñ He's funny that way ñ Though he loves to work and slave for me every day ñ He'd be so much better off if I went away ñ But how can I leave him, where can I go ñ He'd be unhappy without me I know ñ I've got a man crazy for me ñ He's funny that way
How cruel am I to pass you by now? ñ And it's, a cold December ñ In the heat of next July now ñ Will you or won't you remember? ñ Chorus: ñ Our summer, will come again ñ Our summer, melts the ice again ñ Our summer, will come again ñ Our summer, melts the ice again ñ Gypsy whispers with her wild eyes ñ So heavy-handed with the heather ñ She says a change of heart lies ñ With a change, in the weather ñ Chorus x2 ñ Chorus x 3

Joey hit the desert when the sun was high ñ With the help of a flask of lemonade ñ Like some kous-kous western he kept his cool ñ In the shadows that the camel made ñ O my steed is bent like a bedouin tent ñ In a sandstorm i don't wanna be ñ I'll tame the dunes with a nomad tune ñ Yodelloadee! ñ I'm in this land to count the sand ñ Grain by grain for accuracy ñ (see) my camel sits as i sum the bits ñ As a token of fraternity

Slept all day. Awoken at 4:37. Landlady complaining about smell. She has five children by five different fathers. I am sure she cheats on welfare. Soon it will be dark.

The dusk reeks of fornication and bad consciences. I believe I shall take my exercise.

It doesn't matter how you read them, we'll always be on different pages. A big mistake so just erase them, tear them out and burn them. "Please forget because I've forgotten." Say these words and I'll leave. I promise. We'll always be on different pages. Go ahead and turn them. We used to share our smiling faces but honestly those were only phases.

Before the mighty prince of darkness ñ In the presence of the lords of hell ñ I do confess to my past error ñ Despising the ways and path of god ñ Proclaiming that satan rules the earth ñ Making a covenant to honor his name ñ Unholy power fulfills my desires ñ Triumph follows from my chosen will ñ Remove the likes of the imposter ñ He who would deny us pleasures of thy realm ñ Make us worthy to the infernal kingdom ñ Now and for all eternity!
Existence pushed to the lowest level ñ The freedom of spirit the last to remain ....seemingly! ñ All principles sold, given up, for this state of mind ñ The life, for what it is and never should be ñ Only a poor, sick brain and myself left to sell ñ Take it all, don't try to understand ñ The rest of what -- the rest of what was good ñ You won't see, never destroy ñ And all around only agreement ñ To everything that means fun ñ Arguing only a foreign word ñ And I watch the coldness infecting me too
Love writes a letter and sends it to Hate: ñ "My vacation,s ending, I'm coming home late ñ The weather was fine and the ocean was great ñ And I can't wait to see you again" ñ Hate reads the letter and throws it away ñ "No one here..." ñ I'm so happy right now I can barely stand it
Friday's child, hard luck is her brother ñ Friday's child, her sister's misery ñ Friday's child, her daddy they call hard times ñ Friday's child, that's me ñ Friday's child, born a little ugly ñ Friday's child, good looks passed her by...oh ñ Friday's child, makes something look like nothing ñ Friday's child, am I...ya ñ Friday's child, never climbed no mountain ñ Friday's child, she ain't even going to try...oh ñ Friday's child, whom they'll forgot to bury ñ Friday's child, am I
Crushing the serpent with his heel ñ Release false christ first seal mislead ñ And rule the world and lead them into ñ Blindness then comes the war famine death ñ Anarchy now who can hide away from the ñ Judgement of God and who can stand against ñ The wrath of God no man the hail and ñ Fire and blood burns up the earth and ñ Skies the oceans turn to blood and ñ Theres nowhere to hide then comes ñ The dark murder torment anarchy
When there's something inside ñ I can never say a word quite right ñ And I never believed ñ That you wanted much more from me ñ Than a comfort inside ñ And a sedated girl by your side ñ And there's no need to lie ñ All our truths, they will come out in lines and rhymes and reprise once again ñ Broken hearts of yours and mine ñ Crooked teeth from empty smiles ñ I'll take just what you prescribed ñ Medicated forced reply ñ I don't want to ñ Love me like you used to do
Taken for granted, split the atom ñ Make a chain reaction of fusion or fission ñ A ticking timebomb is sleeping, ready to explode ñ And meltdown followed by fallout ñ Don't you know there can be no denial? ñ Don't you know they're polluting the earth? ñ Nuclear generators ñ Red lights flash ñ Foreshadowing the future ñ A smoking gun spewing its filth into the air ñ But they don't care as it darkens the sky ñ Appear a toxic cloud in the atmosphere ñ Encircling the globe come nuclear winter
I'll step aside this time around ñ Open ears await a still and quiet voice ñ Not with the timing that I have ñ Ready to make any change required of me ñ CHORUS: ñ When I can't see where this retarded life of mine is going ñ All I ask is carry me ñ And when I can't see past the cloudy skies that are looming up ahead ñ Hold my hand and carry me ñ Here with the world surrounding me ñ Enduring every day is more then I can do ñ I lack the patience that it takes ñ So I am standing on the promise made to me ñ CHORUS
Full Doc Watson Lyrics...
When the rich die last ñ Like the rabbits ñ Running from a lucky past ñ Full of shadow cunning ñ And the world lights up ñ For the final day ñ We will all be poor ñ Having had our say ñ Put a blanket up on the window pane ñ When the baby cries, lullaby again ñ As the light goes out on the final day ñ For the people who never had a say ñ There is so much noise ñ There is too much heat ñ And the living floor ñ Throws you off your feet ñ As the final day ñ Falls into the night ñ There is peace outside ñ In the narrow light
They talk about you and you don't care ñ The things they tell us, We must beware ñ Out in the darkness you take your prey ñ You rape and kill them, That's what they say ñ *CHORUS* ñ Just who are you, You cannot hide ñ They will get you and you will die ñ Why do you do this, You're just insane ñ You have no feelings, You feel no pain ñ Repeat *CHORUS*
Look up ñ Shades down ñ Cheating the mind ñ Laughing at ourselves ñ Loose hits in ñ Sheltered bins ñ Hide the signs ñ A corner line ñ The best Gin ñ From northern men ñ Be the guide ñ Right by your side ñ Head on ñ Wide open ñ Leading the blind ñ Fascination hell ñ Ride plastic savages ñ End in three's ñ Parts mannequin

Lamar never makes it easy ñ He always wants to meet me ñ Someplace sketchy ñ I stick out like a sore thumb in this part of D.C ñ In this part of D.C ñ He's forty minutes late ñ He keeps trying to gouge me on the price like a prick ñ Whatever ñ As long as the powder's legit ñ I'm all stoked ñ I got my fix ñ Then these thugs roll up ñ With bad intentions
Let your hair down baby, 'n' let's have a natural ball ñ Let your hair down baby, 'n' let's have a natural ball ñ 'Cause when you ain't happy, it ain't no fun at all ñ You can't take it with you, that's one thing for sure ñ You can't take it with you, that's one thing for sure ñ Ain't nothing wrong with you girl, the T-Bone shuffle can't cure ñ Have fun while you can, fate's an awful thing ñ Have fun while you can, fate's an awful thing ñ You can't tell what might happen, that's why I love to sing
Light's flash within the pall ñ Always there, yet unaware ñ A thread that runs through all ñ Time bleeds through while ñ From order they, to disarray ñ Are torn from the thread ñ And so...

I was born secular ñ And inconsolable ñ I heard that he walked ñ He walked the earth ñ  ñ God goes (God goes, God goes) ñ Where he wants ñ And who knows (Who knows, who knows) ñ Where he is not ñ Not in me ñ  ñ It's the way ñ Mothers greet their sons ñ When it's a moment too late ñ It's the law of the land ñ That sometimes the dam just breaks ñ  ñ God works (God works, God works) ñ In mysterious ways ñ And God gives (God gives, God gives) ñ And then he takes ñ From me ñ From me

Burn in memory, filled with tragedy ñ It's sinking deeper, it's crawling nearer ñ Choke on words, or leave it be ñ Must trust yourself, to get through the day ñ Pass the time, to say goodbye ñ Look to the sun ñ Just to find ñ Just to find your judgement ñ But the answers never came ñ A troubled soul, can't get enough ñ To find purpose, or self-destruct ñ Trauma strikes, like it always does ñ Pass the time, to say goodbye ñ Look to the sun ñ Just to find ñ Just to find your judgement ñ But the answers never came
I fell in love with you ñ But I know, I know that's just a sky ñ I don't know where, where I go
Did you ever see me ñ Or could you even see at all ñ I looked at your cold white face ñ So still, so empty ñ Yet i knew you were at rest ñ Much more comforted than I ñ What else could i find to replace who you were ñ It was the carefree unrestricted love that you ñ Never meant to give ñ You never had the choice ñ It was your innocence ñ It was part of who you were ñ It was the comfort of a friend

I saw maybe something you could lust for in a tired way ñ Almost like a brother laying with you in a quiet place ñ Oh, I saw something so good I ought to ñ Celebrate my love for only you ñ Oh, I do
Wild dogs are howling ñ Behind the curtains ñ I hold onto my children ñ The creatures staring in ñ All of my nightmares ñ Are in the garden ñ  ñ Guess again ñ  ñ I'm fighting in the darkness ñ The one who can't be killed ñ Elastic and bionic man ñ  ñ Guess again ñ  ñ As one door shuts ñ Another opens ñ  ñ Guess again ñ  ñ It seems your number's up ñ It seems your number's up ñ It seems your number's up ñ Guess again ñ It seems your number's up ñ It seems your number's up
Greet the dark dawn ñ No will to carry on, no but I have to ñ Don't wanna fight, I'm so tired of that ñ Feel the walls coming down, still I'm holding on ñ When despair grows within, push it down, try again ñ  ñ This ain't goodbye then ñ This ain't goodbye then ñ  ñ Feel the sky coming down, still I'm holding on ñ It makes no sense at all, why I should take the fall ñ Nobody wants it ñ Feel the walls coming down, still I'm holding on ñ Feel the sky coming down, still I'm holding on ñ  ñ This ain't goodbye then

How far you came for me tonight? ñ You never we're the one to ride on airplanes ñ I see now, that you take things as they go ñ And I feel electrified despite ñ The time to celebrate evaporates like cocaine ñ Implore the life I live won't blow ñ I spent my youth living spiteful and jejune ñ Fly above all obstacles in my new hot balloon ñ  ñ Baby don't fret, I'll be right here ñ (Don't fret) ñ Baby don't fret, right here ñ You'll never take the blame by yourself
Contemplate what holds you at this time? ñ Books, self help, pills for your spells ñ Never quiet for fear no one listens ñ Somewhere you'll be someone ñ Become everything you fear ñ Frivolity and its necessities ñ Become everything you fear ñ Frivolity ñ Two and six, tricked to feeling younger ñ Never valiant when it's time ñ He's someone you used to remember ñ Still immersed in mirrors
Mistreated children infected with hate ñ Subject to sick torment ñ Psychologically fucked for life ñ Trying hard to forget ñ Hands and feet tied behind your back ñ Eyes and mouth taped shut ñ Suffering alone in the attic ñ Taste the blood from our cuts ñ Create multiple personalities to deal with the pain ñ Scars of the suffering
The hated journey on the train ñ Always been the same ñ Looking out windows ñ Second class and second best ñ What a waste of time ñ Sleep for five stops in a row ñ Prepare yourself to go ñ Waterloo station ñ Bought a '69 Capri ñ Failed the M.O.T., ñ What a waste of time ñ The Worker, the worker ñ The worker, the worker ñ Always kiss the wife goodbye ñ Often wonder why ñ At seven in the morning ? ñ Think it's time for a change ñ Wouldn't that be strange ñ What a waste of time ñ The worker, the worker ñ The worker, the worker
We all lie to ourselves ñ It never changes a thing ñ Red wine and worry ñ Empty eyes and wanting lips ñ Loss spills over onto itself ñ God damn me and everything ñ The trials of hate and heartache ñ A reminder of my mistakes ñ I will destroy it all
Rise! And look at your face ñ Centre of existence leans toward the end ñ One visage of earth ñ Cold flame under the mask ñ Cracked face of dying spaces ñ Millions of lonely splinters disappear ñ Uniting flame start fading ñ Universe enters the new cycle ñ Outlines of uncountable entity growing grew ñ Morbidly dependent sons of error ñ Great dance comes to an end ñ Spheres of existence reaching the center ñ Forms of existence wash away ñ Resemblance becomes a curse ñ Ultimate justice in nothingness ñ Last error is no more
Hold out your hand ñ And take what you can ñ If you've got a feeling that this feeling might fade away ñ All you have to do is lay this love to waste ñ  ñ Do what I say, do what I say, do what I say ñ Oh, I can change ñ Oh, I can change ñ Oh, I can change your ways ñ  ñ It feels like it was planned ñ And there's something sinister ñ The man with the head in the sand ñ But you really shouldn't make such assumptions, pumpkin ñ  ñ So hold out your hand ñ And take what you can
I drive, I stray ñ For three long days ñ Straight towards the sinking sun ñ Sadness builds, I am done ñ Drifting through the miles ñ No words, no smiles ñ I don't think, I feel ñ I don't speak, I'm just... ñ Halfway gone ñ Caught in between ñ Here and there ñ Hey, hey
There's no blame it's no one's fault ñ What's a life without some salt ñ It's just a life without the sweet and tears
Sheets like shrouds ñ Veils and curtains wrap the orphans ñ Silent clouds ñ Lost in closed-eyed crown ñ Ebb and flow ñ The sound of the rain is an echo ñ That weeps diluvian tears ñ On pristine white snow ñ Lashing storm ñ Outside thuds weave ñ Voiceless laments ñ And blister moons, triumphant
Before leaving get to the bar ñ No one round here makes you pay ñ Never very good at goodbyes ñ So gentle shoulder charge ñ Love you mate ñ Love you mate ñ Salford skyline blue ñ Always you ñ Could fly round any corner ñ But until you do ñ Love you mate
I am everyone's mom ñ Holding hands and cradling along ñ But mom's wouldn't sit in their room ñ All day and wait for something to happen ñ Hey ma, get off your butt and get a part time job ñ Moms wouldn't hide from their kids all day and scribble in a song about doing so ñ I am everyone's mom because I like the ring of it ñ But if I was really your mom you'd be at CPS by now
I came from the streets yea yea
Round my door the leaves are falling ñ A cold wild wind will come ñ Sweethearts walk by together ñ And I still miss someone ñ No I never got over those blue eyes ñ I see them everywhere ñ I miss those arms that held me ñ When all the love was there ñ I wonder if he's sorry ñ For leaving what we'd begun ñ There's someone for me somewhere ñ But I still miss someone ñ No I never got over those blue eyes ñ I see them everywhere ñ I miss those arms that held me ñ When all the love was there

The minute that this love ends ñ You can write down my time of death ñ Non-contingent upon who I am ñ All that matters is who he is ñ Living in a world where they say there's nothing to see ñ And I believed them ñ But God, my spirit's willing, but the flesh is weak ñ I'm ready to let you in ñ You cut the path, and you gave me two feet ñ Now teach me how to walk with them ñ And if I can't walk ñ Then at least carry me

Thrown in the waste paper ñ Got lost in my pocket ñ Bought on the never-never ñ And sold on the tick ñ I would've never known ñ 'Cos no-one would tell me ñ That when they found her body ñ That no offer or ransom ñ Could bring her back to me ñ For a walk in the moonlight ñ I'd pay all the money ñ I'd pay all the money ñ And if we get out of this alive ñ We'll never stop knowing ñ That we had the money ñ We had the money...
Ah ñ Ah ñ Ah-ah-ah ñ Ah (?) ñ Ah-ah ñ  ñ (?) ñ But the other way around ñ Like a goddess sleeping stead ñ I'm coming down ñ I wish that maze had an ending ñ But it just goes round and round ñ I'm looking for a way out ñ But I'm spiraling down ñ  ñ If I tell you why ñ (?) ñ If I tell you why ñ (?)

I can't ignore this game, my dear ñ All your insinuations break me ñ I have a faint, slight idea ñ Of what is like your favourite nation ñ Hit me with one more kiss ñ You won't find a better miss ñ Or just keep wondering in your palace ñ You could as well take me for a flash dance ñ Every single night I'll sleep in silent sights ñ Not to disturb your dreaming ñ No more insinuations or fake idilic nations ñ Will set me far from where you are ñ Each single, warming night ñ Oh, each single, warming night
(Spencer-Brewster-Eccles) ñ Can you hear me? ñ I'm speaking to you ñ This is it ñ There are no more words ñ Come back ñ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Enveloped by somber twilight ñ Upon the ibex gaze ñ A vast orgy of profane bliss ñ A salacious burden into utter paradise ñ Obliteration of adoration ñ Indulgence is eternal under the ibex moon... ñ Massacration of holy lamb ñ Sacriligious dominace ñ Fornicate into oblivion ñ Persuade angels to the abyss!

Abnormal tissue abounds ñ An irritant to rid ñ A fitting treatment found ñ Electric currents assist ñ Wrap the deceased in foil ñ Attach a couple of clips ñ Plug the whole package in ñ Flip the switch and let her rip ñ Spit on the laboratory griddle ñ Watch the sparks increase ñ Fulguration in excess ñ The stench of burning grease ñ Fuses blowing one by one ñ Highly irritating ñ A surgeon needs to be prepared ñ With an extra generator

Wild pain ñ Monday we're so cool ñ Compliments and strange excitements ñ Tuesday I'm so happy ñ Cause this is the rule of our game ñ Wednesday sweet surprise ñ I've been invited out tonight ñ Thursday is so cruel ñ I need mountains of temptation now ñ Friday be crazy 'bout you ñ Warriors of independence ñ Saturday it's time ñ Come on sweetie touch my body - Now! ñ Sunday it's my day ñ Sunday it's our game ñ Explosion, explosion ñ Wild pain ñ Wild pain ñ Wild pain ñ Wild pain ñ Wild pain is to touch my body now ñ Never again
Love, love, love ñ We got it in slop buckets ñ It splashes around in there ñ Some spills, we don't care ñ 'Cause we got plenty of love to go around ñ And when you feel your wits are at an end ñ Remember, we are only animals, my friends ñ Before you spiral down the drain again ñ Let's smile for a while, my friends ñ And have a beer on me
I got the spirit, the spirit in me ñ And there's no way, you're goin' take it out, out ñ Nobody bringing me down ñ Lights keeps on shining, the lights keeps on shining through me ñ Ain't no darkness, ain't no darkness living in me ñ And nobody, nobody bringing me down ñ And nobody, nobody bringing me down ñ And nobody, nobody bringing me down ñ And nobody, nobody, nobody, no
Now I live with nothing to give ñ 'Cause it's gone ñ It's gone ñ It's gone ñ Here I stand at your command ñ 'Cause it's gone ñ Gone ñ Gone ñ 'Cause it's gone ñ Gone ñ Take my hand, our friendship's dead ñ 'Cause it's gone ñ Gone ñ It's one ñ 'Cause it's gone ñ Gone ñ 'Cause it's gone ñ Now I live with nothing to give ñ 'Cause it's gone ñ Gone ñ Gone
I'll get off this boat in a minute ñ 'cause I know you'll be safer without me in it ñ Then you called ñ I love you so ñ Don't ever let me go ñ I will fall to the ground ñ At the time ñ That we meet ñ We were whole ñ Then we peeled off ñ Piece by piece of our souls ñ We were wrong to stay this long ñ Let me go ñ Let me fall to the ground ñ I'm waiting for you to disarm me ñ I'll go off if you don't remove this weight off of me
Fire from our citadels ñ We know we can get you where you are ñ No one can touch us ñ And we will strike you from afar ñ There is no one to hold our fire ñ  ñ Don't try to retaliate ñ You don't know how many that we are ñ There is no one to hold our fire ñ  ñ Yeah, we will cause you pain ñ Yeah, we will cause you pain ñ And yeah, we know who we are ñ And yeah, we know who we are ñ No we're not naming any names ñ No we're not gonna name any names
Green peas, torn jeans ñ Ivy turn about everything ñ Oh well, the smell I know ñ I'll go down in flames ñ Help me (4x) ñ Cornbread, corn fed ñ How in the world ñ Could one walk away from that? ñ I know, I'll go ñ In back and try to forget
Like the numb birds that failed to make their migration ñ Thin flesh, frozen yet dry, has sunken and painted itself to the filthy bones of its dead host ñ Dusted in snow kissed by fuel emissions and dog ejaculation ñ Soil fused to feathersSoil fused to the bodyLess than a statistic so are we
Open arms ñ I was starved ñ White desert ground ñ I was dry ñ A hungry child ñ I lived my life dotted 'i's ñ Knotted fingers toed the line ñ I lived my life dotted 'i's ñ These knotted fingers toed the line ñ Then your open arms, your open arms, your open arms ñ I've been crying all of my life i guess ñ And all my smiles were just cringing and tired ñ Now your sleeves are drying my eyes ñ I find these bleary sights are cuff polished and bright ñ I've been crying all of my life ñ But here entwined in sinew and fire
The token back to Brooklyn fell between the grating ñ And we're just watching it sinking ñ The fare went up to one hundred dollars ñ And we can never go home again ñ The bill collector's drinking lighter fluid ñ And says he'll tell our parents ñ Our feet start running at a furious pace ñ But we can't get away
I close your eyes with my mouth ñ Now you don't see anything ñ But you feel my breath all over ñ I can feel you too ñ  ñ Although I don't really know you ñ I don't really care ñ  ñ Cry with me, make my day ñ Tomorrow all will be gone ñ All the sweetness and all the fun ñ No, I don't wanna know... ñ  ñ  ñ Now that you're gone i don't know ñ How to really feel inside ñ Bearing the hope to see you again ñ I guess I never will ñ Now that I do really know you ñ Yes, I really care!
If it's what you truly want ñ I can wear her skin over mine, her hair over mine ñ Her hands as gloves, her teeth as confetti ñ Her scalp, a cap ñ Her sternum, my bedazzled cane ñ We can pose for a photograph, all three of us ñ Immortalized ñ You and your perfect girl
Heretic ñ The crucible purges all ñ Searching for the devil's mark ñ Under the evil hand ñ Paranoia, accusations ñ (Lies) ñ Spoken in tongues ñ (Possessed) ñ Let the trials begin
O Romeo, O Romeo, Wherefor art thou Romeo? ñ Juliet is not asking Romeo where he is, she is saying "Why are you Romeo?". She wishes he was not from a rival family, but from one that her family trusted.

Walk into the back room. back room ñ Walk into the back room. back room ñ Cold as ice, cold as ice ñ Waiting there ñ Cold as ice
Come to me now that I have found you ñ Come to me, wrap my love around you ñ Look in my eyes, hear what they say ñ Don't run away ñ Stay, stay, stay ñ I'm on fire, let your lips caress me ñ My desire is that you possess me ñ Don't be afraid for love to come to you ñ My lover, come to me ñ Lover, come to me ñ Come to me ñ Don't be afraid for love to come to you ñ My lover, come to me ñ Lover, come to me ñ Come to me
There's a special ñ Place in my heart ñ It's a place in hell ñ For those who believe in hell ñ Hell is real ñ Disbelief is universal ñ I'm closed for business ñ You fucking idiots ñ No matter ñ Whats posed ñ No matter what unfolds ñ I don't believe in shit
There is only- there is only now ñ  ñ It's been a long night with those mischievous souls of Oakland ñ But don't let the fatigue arrest you and get the best of you ñ Hometown hero's almost home ñ  ñ You are listening to K-NOW
Come death of dearling ñ The claws of the raven hold fast ñ Enticed and starving ñ A lustful revenge to the last ñ Unlight flood the seeker's eye ñ Come flame or false hope ñ Gifted in spirit as I ñ Forced upon freedom ñ Let impulse nor stillness be spared ñ Fierce tidal tantrum ñ Nourishing rapture within ñ Come feast or fire ñ Repellent in forceful defence ñ Unchained, forgiving to none ñ Solemn in swirling embrace
And now your face lights up the sky ñ Somehow I feel thats you're close by ñ And when I'm happy you can see ñ I know you're watching over me... Always
You walk around, always screaming about ñ How you're trying to get your way ñ But you should just keep your fucking fat mouth shut ñ If you got nothing important to say ñ Because you...you got a lot to learn ñ All you do is bitch about the things in life that get you down ñ You never care for nobody else ñ If you saw how your life looks to me ñ I think you'd be ashamed of yourself ñ You live inside your fucked-up world ñ Talking loud with nothing to say ñ You got a lot to learn about your life
Listen to my song ñ And if you want to sing along ñ It's about where I belong ñ Texas ñ Sometimes far into the night ñ And until the morning light ñ I pray with all my might ñ To be in Texas ñ It's where I want to be ñ The only place for me ñ Where my spirit can be free ñ Texas ñ It's where I want to be ñ The only place for me ñ Where my spirit can be free ñ Texas ñ Listen to my song ñ And if you want to sing along ñ It's about where I belong ñ Texas
Pain, greed, death ñ Welcome the final prophecy ñ Rage, war ñ Shall destroy the world ñ A new dawn shall rise up and shine ñ This is the words of Nostradameus ñ I'm hearing strange sounds ñ In my study room ñ I know the time to act is now ñ I know visions will prevail for truth ñ Take place before my ball ñ Of crystal so blue...
All creatures of our God and King ñ Lift up your voice and let us sing ñ Alleluia! Alleluia! ñ All creatures of our God and King ñ Lift up your voice and let us sing ñ Oh, sing! ñ Thou rising morn in praise rejoice ñ Ye lights of evening, find your voice ñ Oh, praise Him, praise Him! ñ Praise Him, oh, praise Him! ñ Praise Him!
The beast you've been fighting ñ Is only fooling you ñ It's no use hiding ñ Your still being used ñ It's all-enclosive ñ Soon you'll be consumed ñ Rotting in jail ñ Tortured or ruined
When the off license asks ñ I've been 2 months ñ Checks the crack ñ On their forehead ñ Should comb a hair ñ Over that ñ And these Czech shoes ñ Are a bloody reminder ñ And this town ñ Is not much different ñ The clothes, the stooped appearance ñ Over the hill ñ Goes killer civil servant ñ I still remember ñ The white leafy border ñ The scheiss in winter ñ Over the hill ñ Goes killer civil servant ñ There's a song she had before ñ Borough town ñ That had the snappy rejoinder ñ Who's there? ñ What's wrong? ñ Clear off!
Better than running ñ Stand and take a fight ñ But dare you ñ It's better than losing ñ More than life itself ñ Can you feel it? ñ Another black Saturday ñ Another black Saturday ñ Yeah ñ You think that it's funny ñ I can see you are choking ñ I hope you choke yourself to death ñ Mama ñ See what I have done? ñ I'm getting ready for ñ Another black Saturday ñ Another black Saturday ñ Yeah
Cold dark sea ñ Wrapping its arms around me ñ Pulling me down to the deep ñ All eyes on me ñ I push you away ñ Although I wished you could stay ñ So many words left unsaid ñ But I'm all out of breath ñ  ñ So go, go, go, get out of here ñ Go away, get out of here ñ Go, go, get out of here ñ Go away, get out of here ñ Go, go, get out of here ñ Go away, get out of here ñ Go, go, get out of here ñ Go away ñ  ñ Cold dark sea ñ Your waves are rocking me ñ I close my eyes and fall asleep ñ All eyes on me ñ Your eyes on me
What have you done? ñ What have you done? ñ The sun is gone ñ What have you done? ñ  ñ The universe shifted and all I loved is lost ñ All I love is lost ñ  ñ What have you done? ñ What have you done? ñ The chaos won ñ What have you done? ñ  ñ The universe shifted and all I loved is lost ñ All I love is lost ñ  ñ What have you done? ñ What have you done? ñ What have you done? ñ What have you done?
Revolutionaries don't do sixteens though ñ Al'Tarba, fuck that ! ñ It's been a long time, sure it has ñ  ñ I hope you're ready for the crusader ñ Half-sinner, they call him Luke Vader ñ Magnets from last winter been a 2K version of  ñ  when they said the first ill ñ Apart from Winston while i'm digging on the church hill ñ  I don't shed a tear ñ Initiate  at the gallows in the crowd holding mirrors that they show to the conspirators
Use me, 'cause everyone else is ñ What's the difference? ñ When you're lookin' at my lips ñ And not being legally allowed to kiss them
I was a Teenage Malt Shop! Ha ha!

Spare me - I don't need your yappin' ñ I got directions thrown at me ñ Like I was in need of clues ñ All nite long - all day, night ñ Noon, morning same old song ñ Comes on strong - never ending ñ Bitching my nerves gone twitching ñ Come around wanna cook my goose ñ It's runnin'over and I'm well worth a deuce ñ Fresh out of patience and I'm getting real bored ñ Bet your ass I've heard it before ñ I hear you - but baby you don't move me ñ I've got enough of your predictions ñ And I just don't care what to do

If I could be with you one li'l hour tonight ñ If I was free to do the things I might ñ I want you to know you wouldn't go ñ Until I told you that I loved you so ñ If I could be with you I'd love you long ñ If I could be with you I'd love you strong ñ And I'm telling you for true ñ You'd be anything but blue ñ If I could be with you
All will wither, go to sleep ñ The ones you love you may not keep ñ All you touch will fall apart ñ The dreams you kill will break your heart ñ There's no mercy, there's no rest ñ The void will scream within your chest ñ No one knows and no one will ñ So leave this place that makes you ñ Ill
A sun lingering disease ñ A moon short ñ Stay ñ Cure a sun lingering disease ñ Only a few understand you
Heard the rooster crowing ñ Couldn't see no dawn ñ But I know it won't be long ñ To keep the fire burning ñ Ain't no easy game ñ But we'll do it just the same ñ I'm going to the northland ñ Where the weather keeps you real ñ Till this devil's law is repealed ñ And I know it won't be long
TIME! ñ (Round of Laughter) ñ We blew your mind, huh?
You've changed ñ That sparkle in your eyes is gone ñ Your smile is just a careless yawn ñ You're breaking my heart ñ You've changed ñ You've changed ñ Your kiss is now so blase ñ You're bored with me in every way ñ I can't understand ñ You've changed ñ  ñ You've forgotten the words ñ I love you ñ Each memory that we've shared ñ You ignore every star above you ñ I can't realise you ever cared ñ You've changed ñ You're not the angel I once knew ñ No need to tell me that we're through ñ It's all over now ñ You've changed
Fluid movements ñ Neon lights ñ Play with my eyes ñ Dancing on a grave ñ The two girls knew what they were doing ñ Their robotic song echoed through the remnants ñ But they couldn't stop ñ I heard chanting ñ Endless chanting ñ "God won't forgive you until forgive yourself."

You have been judged on your own accord ñ Our final word seals your fate ñ King of the Jews, the son of God ñ Now condemned to death and hate ñ INRI, INRI, false prophet ñ Carry the cross upon your back ñ And take it to where you'll die ñ A crown of thorns, for you dear king ñ With the other filth, be crucified ñ INRI, INRI, false prophet ñ Taste the blood that trickes from your ravaged brow ñ As the sands of time run out ñ Lord of nothing is what we consider you ñ For victory is truly ours ñ Now you die
When I dream a dream ñ It's from a safe place ñ When reality sets in ñ Proceeding from a dark place ñ Do I dare to dream ñ When dreams can be broken ñ Do I sit and sigh, staring at the sky ñ ...in the night ñ I'm insignificant in a gigantic world ñ A world of hurt and lies, should I cry ñ Should I face my fears and continue ñ Continue to dream for a better future
Everything we just began is over ñ Now we're waiting for everything to be over ñ I was done, I was before everything folded ñ Now that I know, now that we know, you are the drum ñ You are the drum ñ Everything we just began is over ñ Now we're waiting for everything to be over ñ I was done, I was before everything folded ñ Now that I know, now that we know, you are the drum ñ You are the drum ñ And I'm done
I am... ñ I walk slow ñ And I want to waste time ñ I think twice ñ Far behind that crowd ñ I need more ñ And I won't wait ñ I might die ñ For no reason at all ñ Right here ñ Just now ñ I spoke words ñ Only meant for you ñ Right here ñ Right now ñ I spoke words ñ Only meant for you ñ I walk slow ñ And I want to waste time ñ I think twice ñ Far behind that crowd ñ I need more ñ And I won't wait...
Starched white shirts, so neatly pressed by domestic muses ñ Feed delusions that everything is working out right ñ But your ribs can't withstand increasing weight ñ As your heart gets heavier and sooner or later ñ It falls to the tips of your toes ñ And every day tastes like inhaling ñ When you just lit the wrong end (that plastic burning scent) ñ Your only friends are on the exit ramps of gridlock caravans ñ You try to ask how they've been ñ But the metal and glass is too thick
I'll throw you scraps and talk ñ The bad things ñ The language or the motive ñ Affected shown is ñ Self imitating ñ Trust the dying breed ñ The pitch I made has been ñ On my end I trust in ñ What's left here ñ To lie is ñ Admired you trust in ñ Without fear ñ You borrow ñ My world of one speak up ñ The good things ñ The guidelines let me follow ñ Offense is borrowed
I have wished for the wealth of a great millionaire ñ I have reached for a bright star above ñ But the thrill of it all, to me, seems so small ñ When compared to the thrill of your love ñ  ñ I'd rather give everything that I own in this world ñ Than to be all alone and unloved ñ For no earthly price and no sacrifice ñ Is too much to give for your love ñ  ñ I'd rather give everything that I own in this world ñ Than to be all alone and unloved ñ For no earthly price and no sacrifice ñ Is too much to give for your love
Highways full of spirits ñ A red light stops it all ñ Emotions full of tension ñ Rising to your empty soul ñ Where do we go from here? ñ The sky so grey and dark ñ The future's disappearing ñ Feeding like a spark ñ Where do we go from here?
Everything I do ain't right ñ I'ma slip up one day ñ And kill myself ñ While no ones around
I found my ñ She's so far ñ She makes my head ñ I found my soldier girl ñ She's so far away ñ She makes my head spin around ñ I found my soldier girl ñ She's so far away ñ She makes my head ñ She makes my head ñ She makes my head

Side effects, side effects ñ They aren't worth the help you get ñ When you need all the help you can get ñ Friend in fair weather, you're doing just fine ñ You are the one, and you're there just in time ñ The imaginary hill you can't help but climb ñ I don't know who you are most of the time ñ An empire of fiction made of poor little squares ñ No end to your summer, and no end to theirs ñ The only real fire, the only real fact ñ Every act is a move, every move is an act

Walking, attacked by a seagull, attack ñ Continous reflection, once killed a seagull ñ Can the animals revenge, seagull our souls, flying free ñ Abuse another, then just abusing myself, I wonder ñ Flying down the stairs, sucked out of the door ñ Crawling up to the pillar onto a line ñ I want to: glide-birds onto a line ñ She's coming, tries to bite ñ Open the window and let the souls fly free

Don't forget your life in line ñ Don't forget your screaming child ñ Don't forget your innermost feelings ñ I found the evil in me ñ To keep me company ñ Crowding the solitude ñ And their brief multitude ñ Subjection! ñ No man ñ No woman ñ No child alive could please me now ñ Don't embrace this filthy lad ñ Covered with evil sand ñ Find a shelter underground ñ Confess to the god you found

As I reflect on the situation ñ A heavy heart for the task at hand ñ I witnessed savagery ñ Hands tied to destiny ñ The exodus of the chosen ñ As forseen in the prophecy ñ Hiding until it's time ñ To cloud all the human minds ñ When they spoke of the invasion ñ We were chosen from the ties that bind ñ Bloodlines through centuries ñ Destined to be the ones to lead ñ The twelve and I, a new high council ñ Absorb the power of the Watcher's eye ñ The high priest resides in me ñ The elder lives on in all thirteen
You're the dessert brought burning in Bourbon ñ To smiles & glazy widening eyes ñ Extinguished by the breeze of hungry applause ñ And the grabbed forks shine ñ Awake enough to see quivering lips reach toward your soft sweet heart ñ Now loosening flesh in spit of grinding teeth ñ Still trying to distinguish yourself from a ghost ñ Engulfed by the slime of swallowing
Give it all you got, and then your gone ñ Take nothing but your soul ñ Cadillac is rolling down ñ Dust rolling on the sun is dying ñ The dead live in Nevada ñ Two souls are jumping out ñ All the people living out are lying ñ The dead live in Nevada ñ Give it all you got and then your gone ñ Take nothing but your soul
Find my little secret ñ Tack it to my skull ñ Celebrate the idiot ñ With my new quote unquote friends

"This is a song about knowing my eight year old ñ Brother will someday lose his innocence and ñ How it scares me. It' s also about wishing I still ñ Had my innocence.

With an envelope ñ We'll enter buildings we might touch ñ I've got souvenirs but yesterday can't mean too much ñ Have we missed an opportunity? ñ Whispers Chinese leaves a message, leaves a metaphor ñ For what once was gold and once was rich and now is poor ñ Have we missed an opportunity? ñ And the trees lean to lend ñ Can I fold you in fourteen ways to depend not defend?
I am feeling just a little down ñ Nothing I can wrap reasons around ñ But I can ignore it if I look real hard ñ And make perfect triangles out of every three stars ñ Sometimes I make burns on my arms ñ Cause it moves that feeling from my heart to my arms ñ And I'm driving and it keeps me awake ñ I have so many more triangles to make ñ Now that I have planted the seed ñ Maybe those triangles will form without me ñ Surround the world in their crystalline ache ñ And freeze the heroes into glassy mosaics

Driving over Duncan's landing dangerously passed the limit, the sunroof down, all that energy coming through, every single hair on my head moved then I feel nothing, cruising
Changing pictures, bright and framed through window smoke, like fire burning ashes, ashes of your hope. How will you reap the harvest of technology? How will you flee the forest of your insanity? Burning, forest, grueling, harvest, off line frame brain, locked in to the on-line main frame, and rows of houses all the same, and rows of people drenched in plain. Your (our) desire brings on the pain

Tales of beauty, tales of rage ñ Time to leave you, but we'll meet again ñ There's a meaning for longing, my friend ñ The search for strength will never end ñ  ñ Facing trouble, facing defeat ñ Look inside you before you retreat ñ Long lost wisdom proven again ñ Always a turn, a way to defend ñ  ñ From the north ñ Now hear us roar ñ From the north ñ Now hear our call ñ From the north ñ Now hear us roar ñ From the north ñ Now hear our call ñ From the north ñ Now hear us roar ñ From the north ñ Now hear our call

Ribs wrapped in ribbons ñ And his eyes full of clay ñ Tutankhamun's comin' for his summer holiday ñ Walkin' down the road in his chevrolet ñ Better never git in his way ñ Common folk are hummin' ñ Cause Tutankhamun's comin' ñ Ribbons wrap his ribs ñ He remembers what he gives ñ Tutankhamun lives ñ Cause the gibbon never gibs ñ And it's his word ñ That you just heard, oh yes ñ He looks so great, but what is the matter with his eyes?

Writer(s): Wilder/Engvick ñ That year in Oakland High ñ When I was seventeen ñ The grass from there to San Jose ñ Was high and cool and green ñ I see it now ñ Too brash and young was I ñ To know what time could mean ñ The old Acacia lawn cut down ñ Was felt but never seen ñ I see it now ñ That world I knew is lost to me ñ Loves have come and gone ñ The years go racing by ñ I live as best I can ñ And all at once I know it means the making of a man ñ I see it now ñ I see it now ñ I see it now
It's hard to learn ñ How tears can burn one's heart ñ But that's a thing that I found out ñ Too late I guess, cause I'm in a mess ñ My faith has gone ñ Why lead me on this way? ñ I thought there'd be no price on love ñ But I had to pay ñ If I could perform one miracle ñ I'd revive your thoughts of me ñ Yet I know that it's hopeless ñ You could never really care ñ That's why I despair! ñ I'll go along hoping ñ Someday you'll learn ñ The flame in my heart, dear ñ Forever will burn!

It's a shame about the roadblock, we're afraid that we'll get caught or stopped ñ Let's go right now, surf city eastern block ñ I'm in the trunk my surf board on top ñ The eighties ain't been kind to anyone, I just wanna find myself some sun ñ It's 1984, I'm on the run, goodbye Berlin, hello Autobahn ñ It's a shame about the roadblock ñ If they catch us, we won't ever talk ñ Let's go right now surf city eastern block ñ I'm in the trunk when the inspector knocks
A dirty street outside my room, papers swirl around ñ Not a soul on a night of gloom, tries to stop a howl ñ Another day on a dismal beach, a seagull turns and flys by ñ The waves seem so high and fierce, break and crash back down ñ If the worst should happen, or if it takes all day ñ Or if the sun turns grey and cold ñ Violent wind come blow me down ñ Ring chimes with a haunting air ñ The curtains whoop and the dogs they growl ñ Otherwise a silent town
God gave you your eyes and made them blue ñ And your daddy's too ñ God gave you a heart and made it strong ñ Because he knew the hours could be so long ñ God gave me these arms so I could hold you ñ So let me hold you ñ It's all I want to do ñ God gave me these ears so I could hear you ñ Say the things that truly are so dear to you ñ And you got me for all time ñ Always and forever, right beside ñ And you've got me for all time ñ Always and forever, right beside ñ You ñ I have seen the ocean in your eyes ñ Your big blue eyes

Maybe September ñ I'll love again ñ Maybe a rainbow ñ Will catch me then ñ This little boy lost ñ Will find his way once more ñ Just like before ñ When lips were tender ñ The shade of a willow ñ Where love was born ñ A face on a pillow ñ In early morn ñ I still see that golden world ñ In all it's splendor ñ Maybe September ñ Love will come again ñ A taller tree, a sweeter log ñ A bluer morning sky above ñ And maybe come September ñ I'll share these wonders ñ With my love
Beneath the Bronze sky ñ A Horizon in Flame ñ The Oceans Boil ñ The Earth heaves ñ ...and seethes ñ There is a new Sun rising ñ That has not Risen for ñ Thousands of years ñ Prophets have Written ñ Songs have been Sung ñ We have Awoken ñ A New Age has begun ñ Spirit The Earth Aflame ñ "...And so it starts... ñ The beginning of a new turn in the cycle..."
My whole life I had this feeling ñ What we see is not the ceiling ñ Must be more than what they're teaching us ñ Thought that all we needed was love ñ  ñ Nights I lie here contemplating ñ Why we spend our lives just waiting ñ For something that might be saving us ñ When all we really needed was love ñ Was love ñ Oh, whoo-hoo, hey ñ Ooh ñ  ñ Maybe when the world stops spinning ñ It will only be beginning ñ Galaxies are spirits living above ñ We won't need anything but love ñ No, we won't need anything but love ñ But love
Awoke today with no new ideas ñ But that's nothing new ñ And as I grow old only one thing does not ñ For love you are the one I choose ñ So I wish you would know that you are so beautiful ñ Our love I will continue to be post modern ñ It will take more than six feet of earth to seperate this love ñ And so forever I am yours
I'll have a blue Christmas without you ñ I'll be so blue just thinking about you ñ Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree ñ Won't be the same dear, if you're not here with me ñ And when those blue snowflakes start fallin' ñ That's when those blue memories start callin' ñ You'll be doin' all right, with your Christmas of white ñ But I'll have a blue, blue, blue, blue Christmas ñ You'll be doin' all right, with your Christmas of white ñ But I'll have a blue, blue Christmas ñ But I'll have a blue, blue Christmas
Why do you want to get down ñ If you're so special? ñ Why do you want to get down ñ If you're so special? ñ Why do you want to get down ñ If you're so special? ñ Don't you worry, don't you worry ñ Why do you want to get down? (Get down)

Dead brides in white they make out all right ñ Get up in the morning or the middle of the night ñ I never work hard, I never do right
Man, please dude ñ I ain't even tryna hear about no jet lag ñ Man, I been up in the hole for like three days dude ñ We Tunnel Rats man, you know how we do it man ñ Just get hyped man, give 'em attitude ñ Put it on 'em, let's do this!
This is Robot 13 speaking ñ Planet Earth is turning round ñ Although my mind is gently weeping ñ I know my hope is coming to an end ñ Evil is in your heart now ñ Disillusion is in your soul ñ Oh my dear god can you really hear me ñ If so, then please help me find a way ñ Although my eyes are gently sleeping ñ I know my mind is coming to an end
Take a look and see ñ Just take a look around ñ It's a hunter's moon ñ Hear the music of the dogs a 'calling ñ Singing songs so free ñ Baby you do seem ñ Thankful just to be ñ Hey, whoever you are ñ Come sit here ñ Stay so far ñ Time is short ñ The end draws near ñ Time is now ñ Channel your fears ñ Channel all your fears ñ Say, what did you see? ñ I saw the mountains crumble ñ I set the blind man free ñ Speak, what did you feel? ñ I touched the sword of hatred, lord ñ I split the rock of fear
I'm waiting, please come by ñ I've got the guts now ñ To meet your eye ñ Those guts are killing ñ But I can't stop now ñ Got to connect with you girl ñ Before I forget how ñ Please wanna hang around? ñ You've got to wonder ñ What it is we found ñ I'm waiting, please come by ñ I've got the guts now ñ To meet your eye ñ Those guts are killing ñ But I can't stop now ñ Got to connect with you girl ñ Before I forget how ñ Please wanna hang around? ñ You've got to wonder ñ What it is we found ñ  ñ Thanks a lot
Everybody that you've ever known is gonna fdie ñ Don't cry, there's a big white bed up in heaven ñ There's nothing you can say or do that's gonna save your life ñ It's all right, there's a big white bed up in heaven ñ If the plane you're sitting in disintegrates into the sky ñ That's life, there's a big white bed up in heaven ñ Didn't do all things you thought you'd do before you die? ñ That's fine, there'll still be time up in heaven
Threw my bike off the road and lie in the grass ñ The hot winds blow, promises I'll never know ñ Don't act twelve with a delinquent mind ñ The sky turned yellow-blue like a week-old bruise ñ These days things loom above me, my head is empty ñ My tongue and lips are swollen
'Cause I still see ñ With the same green eyes from when I was a kid ñ Young and scared of the world ñ 'Cause I still kiss ñ With the same chapped lips from when i was six ñ And I still feel ñ With the same frail fingers, does my scent linger ñ In the linen sheets of your bed ñ I'm still full of shit, you don't buy a word that I say ñ But it's okay, I wouldn't either
Masquerade, 93.1, this is Big E ñ Who goes there ñ Hello, yes, am I on the air ñ Fo sho, live and clear, baby ñ Hi, this is Kwaliah, I would like to request a song ñ Make it quick or get the click, mama ñ I wanna hear I'm a th, what's that shh ñ That Thug Like Me, Kwa ñ Alright Instant Request, Masquerade Hot 93.1, baby
Lyrics coming
Great explorers know no boundaries ñ Short of praying ñ Your children are just waiting for a chance ñ Came from France, a credit note ñ Broke his daddy's heart ñ After all they did for him ñ Broke his daddy's heart ñ The number one fruit seller! ñ She will only disappoint you ñ Happy hardcore isn't quite as happy as you'd think ñ Came from France, a credit note ñ Broke his daddy's heart ñ After all they did for him ñ Broke his daddy's heart ñ The number one fruit seller! ñ She is only here as ballast
It's a good idea ñ Been tried and true ñ When a mother lies because it's ugly ñ That's not funny ñ So go back to back ñ To find the newest news ñ When a husband lies because it's ugly ñ That's not funny ñ That's not funny ñ That's not funny ñ That's not funny ñ That's not funny ñ That's not funny ñ That's not funny ñ That's not funny ñ That's not funny ñ That's not funny ñ That's not funny
I have conveniently misplaced my parachute pack. I don't fear gravity. If you need me, come find me where the GPS can't -- that's where I'm setting up camp. I followed the riverbend to fly fish in the future. Caught me marlin swimming in oblivion. Youthful curiosity. Why live if you ain't living? Save your kerosene -- don't leave the light on for me. If all goes to plan, me and the fam ain't returning.
Inside outside ñ It's all to say to me ñ Before we got there ñ I knew I lost ñ I thought to listen ñ Walking open to the house that we lived ñ I hear a few ñ I have a new ñ I hear a few ñ I head to you ñ Bridled evening ñ In time break into ñ Brushing past ñ Eatiest ñ In the streets ñ In the loss ñ Darkness ñ Winced then ñ Lights surround  ñ We part ñ All lost ñ Without  ñ I head a few ñ I have a new ñ I have a new ñ I have a you ñ I head with you ñ I head ñ I head ñ I head a few
Something surrounds me ñ The space at the ocean shore ñ The white crash of the waves ñ Accepting our weakness ñ There's nothing that says "be strong" ñ Of strength i'm ashamed ñ It's all I know ñ It pulls my way ñ It seems ñ Accepting our weakness ñ There's nothing that says "be strong" ñ Of strength I'm afraid
Come and get it now, ooh ñ The drummer,  alright, let's give everybody some ñ (Give everybody some, yeah) ñ  ñ You better give that bass-player some ñ Yeah, the bass-player  ñ He can have this from me ñ Give the bass player some ñ Alright bass, you got it ñ La-la ñ La-la-la-la la, la-la-la la ñ  ñ La la la-la la (Give everybody some) ñ Give everybody some
So you're sending me on a holiday ñ Where did the time go ñ I saw it pass away ñ We wear nothing but sad faces ñ Where did the time go ñ I saw it pass away ñ Pain is simple confidence ñ It helps me to slow down ñ Slow it down ñ We go nowhere but old places ñ Where did the time go ñ That way ñ Slow it down ñ We were old familiar strangers ñ How was the time though ñ Not bad ñ Pain is simple confidence ñ Helps me to slow down ñ Slow it down
Ooh, whatever's gonna happen tonight ñ Ooh, whatever's gonna happen tonight ñ It stays on the dancefloor ñ It's only between you and I ñ And I won't tell a soul ñ As long as he can see my blue eyes ñ Whatever's gonna happen ñ For sure, stays on the dancefloor ñ Buff tingaling, buff tingaling ñ Buff tingaling (Ta da da) ñ Buff tingaling (Ta da da)
I know we can talk about it ñ I know we can live without it ñ What makes you feel this way? ñ I wish I could say ñ I know we can get through it ñ What will it take to make it? ñ Does it seem that hard? ñ Why do I feel this way? ñ It happens everyday ñ When will it go away? ñ This sickness killing me ñ When will it be ok? ñ I know we can get through it ñ What will it take to make it? ñ Does it seem that hard? ñ In the back of my mind it gets me every time ñ In the back of my mind it gets me every time
Yes, yes, yes ñ My soul says... ñ Yes, yes, yes ñ My soul says... ñ Lord, I want to be ñ All that You want me to be ñ I surrender my everything ñ I surrender my all to Thee ñ A living testimony, I want to be ñ In everyday, In every way ñ Lord, help me today ñ I want to sing... ñ Yes, yes, yes ñ My soul says yes
I stare out my window and into yours ñ Looking for something to fuck myself to ñ Either change the channel or pull the fucking shade ñ Its all bad t.v. with nothing but bad t.v. in-between ñ Why the fuck do you even exist?
The Pendergast Machine is humming ñ Oiled up she's really running, man I never seen it coming ñ Boys, don't ask questions ñ It takes a blind eye sometimes to see such things actually happen ñ You don't know your own strength ñ Walk to your own beat, the secrets that you keep ñ You don't know your own strength ñ Novel sounds of the nouveau south, worked their way throughout the crowd ñ And just when I had given up ñ But I would do my best to not deconstruct myself too much
Boys don't cry, they just want to die ñ Stumbling, coughing, grin or lie ñ Will you look into my eyes? ñ Will you be my new dress? ñ Box up all of your things with tape ñ Write your address, hope it won't be late ñ Can I still be your pessimist? ñ Boys don't cry, they just want to die ñ Stumbling, coughing, grin or lie ñ Will you look into my eyes? ñ Will you be my new dress?
Wake up, wake up ñ I got your breakfast waiting for you by the stove ñ I got your shower running and I cleaned your clothes ñ Wake up, wake up ñ Ooohhh ñ Wake up, wake up ñ I got your breakfast waiting for you by the stove ñ I got your shower running and I cleaned your clothes ñ Your tie is on the bed and don't forget cologne ñ Wake up, wake up
I hear the night calling, it knows my name ñ I hear the night screaming, summoned again ñ My need, my lust for vengeance, black wings of hate ñ My wrath at last has reason, legions awake ñ And when the night calls we rise, we kill ñ Our covens grow in darkness, nurtured by weed and pills ñ Rise, rise, legions of Hatred, rise, rise, legions of Hatred ñ Rise, rise, legions of Hatred, oh right now
Here I sit, guns in my hands ñ Upon the glass we make our plans ñ She is my body, our forbidden glam ñ Oh here I sit, guns in my hands ñ Upon the glass we make our plans ñ She is my body, our forbidden glam ñ Oh ñ Whoo
Is this house? ñ Is this house? ñ Is this house? ñ Etc etc etc
This river flows to the South ñ Like these thoughts flow from my veins ñ Blood like fuel is fed to the fire ñ Inspired by faces in the flames ñ In the boats we crosses over the water ñ The edge of the Earth fell away ñ On the banks we stood alone ñ As dreams were washed out to sea
Into this world, short of life ñ Without breath, void of light ñ Into this world, short of life ñ Without breath, void of light
I can't breathe anymore... I can't breathe ñ I can't breathe anymore... I can't breathe ñ The air is too thin... too thin... too thin... too thin...
I'm leaving all I know behind ñ I'm leaving only dusty outlines in place ñ Of this place I've loved to pieces ñ I'm leaving all the lakes behind ñ Where the sweetest soul singer came to die ñ Does someone know if the lethal blow ñ Was the impact or the cold? ñ I've been a lost soul before ñ I've left all I've loved before ñ When lost souls stay, just one more day ñ So far away ñ It's lovely
To be alive but never to dream ñ To be another failure, the world didn't need ñ To be the voice of insecurity ñ To be the broken man, to be the waterless seed ñ I'll never life on my knee's, I know a promise holds more to me ñ I'll never make the same mistakes, a conscious mind, I'll never break
And now the covers have blown finally ñ I'll do this one right ñ Colour all the blue days for the kind I wish I had ñ And birds sing all night ñ I've no reason, I've no reason, I've no reason to fight ñ Lovers bear the weight of it ñ Lovers visionary ñ Who won't say goodbye
Waiting to get to your room ñ Hallways ñ Always waiting, feels like I've been waiting for days ñ In these hallways ñ Wait, wait, wait ñ Wait, wait, wait ñ Wait, wait, wait ñ Walls cave ñ Turns refuse to waste ñ Hallways ñ Knock, knock, knock, broken lock ñ I'll just wait in the ñ Hallway ñ In some small way, oooh ñ This can be a pleasurable phase ñ Walls cave ñ Turns refuse to waste ñ Hallways ñ Walls cave ñ Turns refuse to waste ñ Hallways ñ In the hallways, girl ñ She turns to you to say ñ "Always"
Act I : The tenth persecution (Diocletian) ñ Diocletian ñ Maximian ñ Galerius ñ Constantius ñ Persucting Christians ñ Deprived of their ranks ñ Under Diocletian ñ Ruling with the four edicts ñ A bloody ruthless tetrarchy ñ Prohibiting Christians to worship ñ Liturgical books were destructed ñ Imperial freedmen were re-enslaved ñ Edict were pursued with bloodsheds ñ Imprisoning of all bishops and priests ñ Converting to Roman religious practices
You standed in the way ñ Why are you angry ñ I'd reverse things I say ñ It won't change ñ It won't change a thing ñ Why ñ Why ñ Oh, why ñ Why ñ A few memories ñ They could wait whenever ñ Not always ñ Bursting into tears ñ Never again brings another  ñ I'd like orphans to drift ñ To words you take you in ñ I'd the wind to be ñ Strong enough to push you out ñ Why? ñ Why ñ Oh, why ñ Why ñ Why ñ Why ñ Oh, why ñ Why ñ Why ñ Oh, why ñ Why
We are the ugly faces ñ In all the darkest places ñ Careless and impatient ñ Fell so far from your graces ñ Busy but fucking bored ñ The kids that you ignored ñ But while your back was turned ñ We crossed the bridges that you burned ñ We gotta get it, there's a fire in this town tonight ñ Off my feet into the street ñ We're gonna do it right
You can't take hold of me! ñ I gave up everything! ñ The photograph reveals the life, we once had! ñ You can't take hold of me! ñ I gave up everything! ñ You never understand the circumstance ñ I'm never coming back ñ And I'll give it up ñ Pretend it's not corrupt ñ But I know it's never coming back to me ñ Cause what's never known ñ I wish could be shown ñ But this testimony's not working for me ñ And this time don't come running back! ñ Remember the Maine!!!! INCOMING!!! INCOMING!!!!
Will you ever ñ Say you love me ñ Say you want me ñ Or whatever? ñ I have wondered ñ If you need me ñ It doesn't always ñ Seem like it ñ  ñ But after all is fine ñ That you need this much time ñ It's obvious what you think ñ I understand ñ  ñ Will you ever ñ Care about me ñ Ask about me ñ Talk whenever? ñ I've been waiting ñ Really struggling ñ Since forever ñ To make you smile ñ  ñ But if you say goodbye ñ I won't be asking why ñ It's obvious what you think ñ About us ñ  ñ I'm tired of everything ñ Let me know ñ Oh, do you feel the same?
If you're happy, then I'm alright ñ If you're scared, then I'll shine the light ñ My fear's tucked in this white balloon, I let it go for you ñ If you need me, I'll be here all day and all night ñ If you did it wrong, then let's make it right ñ My storm's locked in this white balloon I let it go for you ñ Winter solstice ñ Guessing new changes ñ If you're happy then I'm alright ñ I'll sing to you every night ñ As the sun sets in the desert night, I'm humble by the light ñ I'm humble by the light
The trees are shedding their lust (last?) ñ Delicately siliciferous ñ Indifferent but also inviting ñ I want to be that leaf spiraling ñ In the first flight of the wind blown clouds ñ And after that.... ñ I want nothing at all."
Sweet life, where are you now ñ I'm here, here on the couch ñ Too many pills, and songs, songs for tomorrow ñ Tonight I'll use my coat for a pillow ñ  ñ  ñ Morning shakes like the trees ñ Sugar fills up my veins ñ Loneliness fills my heart, my heart full of sorrow ñ Tonight I used my coat for a pillow ñ  ñ  ñ Who will be my life ñ To tell me where to go ñ  ñ Sleep now, sleep on the pain ñ Sleep now, sleep on the pain ñ Sleep now, sleep on the pain
I am everything... ñ I am nothing... ñ In the peitry dish ñ Of the creator...
I want to drink your blood this night ñ A Satanic night of fullmoon ñ She meets pure essence of evil ñ Masquerade as an angel of light ñ She becomes Bride of Darkness ñ Licks the burning crossbleeding mouth ñ "I want to drink from you" "You can drink from me" ñ Til the last drop of blood ñ If you want to enjoy.. this night ñ Let me suck from your neck ñ The wolves will dance around you ñ Your orgasm in the Pentacle!! ñ Tilt the last drop of blood
When all waters still ñ And flowers cover the earth ñ When no tree is shivering ñ And the dust settles in the desert ñ  ñ When I can take your hand ñ On any crowded street ñ And hold you close to me ñ With no hesitating ñ  ñ Oh, my love ñ Oh, my flower ñ Oh, hold my hand
Jitterbug ñ Jitterbug ñ Jitterbug ñ Jitterbug ñ  ñ That's not how we do it ñ Is this gonna go on forever and ever? ñ Somebody end this dance lesson ñ There were some cute ideas there
Oh good God what has he done ñ Traded a heart for a bullet and a mind for a gun ñ Said he needed a bat to clear the way ñ Now he won't sit back so he starts to pray ñ But oh, it ain't so ñ I can still make you ... ñ I, I'm on your side
Listen, everybody ñ You know there's lots of trouble in the world ñ You know about the danger ñ There's trouble up ahead ñ You wanna finish up? ñ I don't wanna finish up, I wanna live ñ You wanna be here tomorrow? ñ Then you gotta be strong ñ For our children's future ñ You gotta be strong ñ There's trouble up ahead ñ You wanna live tomorrow? ñ You gotta be strong ñ Everyone of us ñ You gotta be strong ñ To take care of this country ñ We gotta be strong ñ All the people, all around ñ We gotta be strong ñ We got to be strong
I'm losing sleep a thousand miles away from my you ñ Unloved, in the dialtone ñ It's just not that simple when the perfect words don't ever seem to fit ñ She just slipped under harmony and now I'm empty handed ñ I'm just half empty, a second best ñ Somewhere it's too soon, it's just not enough ñ It's never enough
Oh, oh... ñ Sincerely, sincerely ñ Sincerely ñ Oh, yeah, sincerely ñ Cause I love you so dearly ñ Please say you'll be mine ñ (Say you'll be mine) ñ Oh, you know how I love you ñ I'll do anything for you ñ Please say you'll be mine ñ Oh, love ñ Won't you tell me why ñ Why I love you so ñ She doesn't want me ñ Oh, I'll never (never) ñ Never (never) ever go ñ Sincerely ñ Oh, I love you (sincerely) ñ I'll do anything ñ For you (sincerely) ñ Please say you'll be mine ñ Oh, ba ba ba... ñ Say you'll be mine ñ (Sincerely) ñ (Sincerely)...

Some days I feel tangerine ñ Some days I feel blue ñ Some days I just wanna black out ñ Everything I felt for you ñ Even though I take your picture ñ Everywhere I go ñ I use it for a coaster ñ And drink the overflow ñ  ñ Some days I make a lot of money ñ And give it all away ñ To take my mind off the tangerine color ñ Of your negligee ñ Beggars can't be choosy ñ And they don't know how to serve ñ You got a different phone number ñ And a lot of nerve ñ  ñ Some days I feel tangerine ñ Some days I miss you too
Spinning round, demanding a gentle way ñ Rushed up crowd, had to go off the way ñ (chorus) ñ Oh, the circumstances detailed ñ The force of the run ñ Oh, the messages unfold ñ There goes a beautiful world ñ Higher ground, safe from the open way ñ Desert hound, try to get hold of me ñ (chorus x2) ñ There goes a beautiful world ñ There goes a beautiful world ñ (chorus x2) ñ There goes a beautiful world ñ There goes a beautiful world
We'll all look the same someday ñ And even now the robot starts to think ñ I wonder what it dreams
I've been thinking too much about you ñ See the sunset with no sleep at all ñ Constantly thinking about you ñ And I can't get through this at all ñ I've been thinking too much about you ñ I've been staring at the floor ñ I've listened to all the tunes I love ñ But made me feel quite blue ñ I've been thinking too much about you ñ See the sunrise still no sleep at all ñ Constantly thinking about you ñ And my eyelids won't close at all
(I'm just a statistic) ñ (I'm just a statistic) ñ (I'm not brittle) ñ (I'm not a diagnosis) ñ (I'm not a diagnosis)
In the stillness of a day dreaming to the blazing sun ñ Unbeknownst I soon will be deep in the cosmic cauldron ñ Evil incoming now I will be their window to Earth ñ Without warning now should I begin to fear the worst ñ Now the host has settled in I'm full controlled and occupied ñ Hearing voices see strange worlds flickering all through my mind ñ All while the citizens beware my seemingly madness ñ They convince the clergyman that I'm clearly possessed ñ Shadow out of time
Clouds hang over creaking glass ñ Power lines strung above ñ These streetlights hum this city's song ñ When I stand there, this is mine ñ When I am there, this is home ñ When I stand there, this is mine ñ When I am there, this is home
No one ever told me what to think when I'm alone ñ No one ever told me how to feel when emotion is cold ñ Can she save me from my disease? A token sunrise sickens the incomplete ñ It's an off day when I'm in control ñ It's awfully hard to run away when my foot's stuck in a hole ñ I thought it was remission and it felt so glorious ñ But it was adequate compared to what I am ñ Compared to who I'm trying to be, yeah ñ And I don't even know who I think I'm trying to be

You and me ñ We are destined, you'll agree ñ To spend the rest of our lives ñ With each other ñ The rest of our days like two lovers ñ Forever, yeah ñ Forever ñ My bijou
This is all everything is yours ñ This is all and I give you away ñ This is all everything is yours ñ But I'm missing ñ Oh, yeah"| ñ Ooops! ñ Goddamned! ñ Thieves are got to, got to ñ Rob me ñ Booze ñ And bills ñ Thieves are got to "get ya!" ñ Rob me ñ Shoot in a moment ñ Shoot in a moment ñ So smooth in a moment ñ Mighty blow ñ This is all everything is yours ñ This is all and I give you away ñ This is all everything is yours ñ But I'm missing ñ Oh, yeah"| ñ I don't regret ñ Oh, yeah"|
I walked in a straight line ñ Went up to the New York border ñ Been following ? lines, honey ñ And I hit the snow ñ I found where my faith lies ñ Wrapped up like a small novella ñ Been taped by a hundred pictures ñ All of you, oh ñ I walked in a straight line ñ Went up to the New York border ñ Been following ? lines, honey ñ And I hit the snow
This is a breakdown ñ You are a cancer ñ This will be the death of me ñ I'll never live this down ñ You will never ñ An amazing fall from grace ñ No more or less than I deserved ñ A gentleman a liar and a cheat ñ And all that's left for me ñ Is to usher in the death of a broken man ñ And the birth of another ñ We all seem safe in the knowledge ñ That you are watching over ñ Everything that we do ñ This is a breakdown ñ You are a cancer ñ You've got a lot to answer for
I will, I will, I ñ I will be with you ñ I will follow you ñ Anywhere ñ I will, I will, I ñ I will be with you ñ I will follow you ñ Anywhere ñ I will follow you ñ Anywhere
Rationalise this fear of cats ñ He sees a couple in the morning ñ Wrap them up in plastic film and seal them in ñ Right down here ñ See him cower awful and keenly laugh over ñ He seems infallible ñ And another new song ñ And another new song ñ Right down here ñ Rest in the room in powder ñ And leaving him alone ñ Stinking like an eye cream ñ See him all, rain is clean ñ The cat's walking in the room
This next song, ladies and gentlemen is, a brand new exclusive tune ñ And we just got off the press ñ Straight, from us to you, music out today and tomorrow
Got to go,I got to go ñ I fall in lonely love with you ñ Uh ah ñ Got to go,I got to go ñ I'm so in lonely love with you ñ Uh ah ñ Don't know how many time I try ñ I wanna tell you 'bout it over the night ñ Don't know why,baby,no reply ñ I'm gonna hang out with you over the world ñ Love will shine with you ñ Don't go anymore ñ Don't go anymore ñ Fool groove ñ Love will shine with you ñ For evermore ñ It's for evermore ñ With you
Come to the city where madness takes over ñ Come to the land where the nightmare comes true ñ Open your mind to a fantasy-travel ñ Where no more rules dominate out this world ñ I know and i remember the silences ñ I've seen and i don't relate of death ñ All i've seen and all i wanted ñ I wasted my time, now i flow with the sand ñ I've never begun, i haven't finished, yet ... ñ I am a step out of memory
He's the man with all the toys ñ  ñ Someone found a lighted house late one night ñ And he saw through the window a sight ñ A big man in a chair ñ And little tiny men everywhere ñ He's the man with all the toys ñ Well how thrilled that someone must have been ñ And he must have been tempted to go in ñ He stayed out in the cold ñ And when he left them he told ñ About the man with all the toys ñ  ñ He's the man with all the toys ñ The man with all the toys ñ He's the man with all the toys ñ The man with all the toys
Tears keep rolling down your cheek ñ Your voice gets choked so you can't speak ñ Every day seems like a week ñ  ñ And that's what it's like to be lonesome ñ  ñ You get too blue to stay at home ñ But in a crowd you're still alone ñ You lose the will to carry on ñ  ñ  ñ Everyone has a hope that's died ñ Everyone cries a tear inside ñ Everyone has a cross to bear ñ But I've got more than my share ñ Your mind is built with memories ñ Your heart cries out for sympathy ñ An empty blue eternity
Penis vagina sex dicks balls cock ñ My dick is hard as a rock (aye) ñ Penis vagina sex dick dick dick ñ My dick is long as a stick ñ Sticky is my cum ñ I'm hot as the sun ñ While your all the way down there ñ Cluck cluck cluck goes the chicken ñ Fuck fuck fuck goes me ñ Riding on all those hoes ñ You got a fat dick ñ We call that a choad ñ You got a fat dick ñ And we throw it on the road ñ Got a fat dick ñ Make her give you head ñ Got a fat dick ñ Put it in her in the bed
Rememberin' moments, so precious and real ñ The thought of you, kissing me there ñ You know my secrets ñ You know the curve and the line ñ One touch, and I know you are mine ñ Rain falls down on me ñ I can hardly see, for the water in my eyes ñ Love comes down on me ñ I can hardly breathe, for the trembling in my thighs ñ You move me ñ {Repeat All}
It's time for debation, it is time to elect ñ Elect a new president, oh ñ What am I going to do ñ Keagan's in office until 1984 ñ Are we going to fight Russia ñ Are we going to live in peace ñ Are we going to elect ñ Democrat or republican
Under open skies I leave the day behind ñ Wonder in my eyes, the world feels so alive ñ I just speak Your name and my heart seems to change ñ God of truth and grace, I can only praise You ñ And the stars are singing out ñ The glory of Your wondrous love ñ Heaven's reaching down ñ To show me all that You have done for me ñ Under soft twilight, I can hear your voice tonight ñ Your name is higher than the Heavens ñ Your glory fills a million skies ñ Your heart is reaching down from heaven ñ And my soul cries out to You
It's a lonesome old town, when you're not around, I'm lonely, as I can be ñ I never knew how much I missed you, but now I can plainly see ñ It's a lonesome old town, when you're not around ñ How I wish you'd come back to me ñ I never knew how much I missed you, but now I can plainly see ñ It's a lonesome old town, when you're not around ñ How I wish you'd come back to me ñ How I wish you'd come back to me
It could be simple ñ I could be simply not enough ñ Just come around girl ñ Give me a chance ñ To talk me up

Some great ñ Anti-action ñ Keeps me ñ Moving faster ñ Eyes like ñ Steak knives ñ Turn me on ñ Look down ñ To the side ñ I'm not ñ On her mind ñ She's ñ Crying
Pentadactylon ñ Five-fingered hand of doom ñ Curling upwards ñ A burning devil's wrath ñ Chiranthodendron
Siren with a song in your eye ñ Slashing through my ear like a beast ñ Seven times I leapt upon your shore ñ Every night I let you conquer me ñ You're my Queen, You're my Queen ñ You're my Queen, You're my Queen ñ Serpent with your blue planet eyes ñ Passing like a ship through my sleep ñ Seven times I kissed you on the mouth ñ Every night I let You conquer me ñ You're my Queen, You're my Queen ñ You're my Queen, You're my Queen
It makes me laugh to see you smile ñ And I'm so sad when you cry ñ And it's easy to see, this came to be ñ 'Cause you're a little piece of me ñ Once upon a time, I really wondered ñ If you were gonna happen at all ñ But in the back of my mind ñ There you were all the time ñ And now you're on my knee ñ Well, your momma and me ñ We wondered and we prayed ñ And your little heart grew stronger ñ As we waited for your day ñ You were a little late arriving ñ So we took some time deciding on your name ñ Julia
Oh, yes I'm wrong, but you are wronger ñ Oh, yes I'm wrong, but you are wronger ñ Maybe you're right, but I am righter ñ Maybe you're right, but I am righter ñ Because I'm writing this song for you ñ Because I'm writing this song for you ñ I'm wrong, you're right because ñ I lied about this writing
1, 2, 3, 4! ñ  ñ Clocks are big, machines are heavy ñ Clocks are big, machines are heavy ñ Clocks are big, machines are heavy!
You never get out ñ Never get out ñ No escape ñ No way out ñ There is no escape ñ No way out ñ You never get out ñ Never get out ñ You never get out ñ Never get out ñ Close the windows ñ Close the doors ñ You never get out ñ Never get out ñ No escape ñ No way out ñ There is no escape ñ No way out ñ You never get out ñ Never get out
Love me tender ñ Love me sweet ñ Never let me go ñ You have made my life complete ñ And I love you so ñ  ñ Love me tender ñ Love me true ñ All my dreams fulfilled ñ For my darling I love you ñ And I always will ñ  ñ Love me tender ñ Love me long ñ Take me to your heart ñ For it's there that I belong ñ And we'll never part ñ  ñ Love me tender ñ Love me dear ñ Tell me you are mine ñ I'll be yours through all the years ñ Till the end of time ñ  ñ  ñ (When at last my dreams come true ñ Darling this I know ñ Happiness will follow you ñ Everywhere you go)
Do there exist many worlds, or is there but a single world?
When I fall in love ñ It will be forever ñ Or I'll never fall in love ñ In a restless world like this is ñ Love has ended before its begun ñ And too many moonlight kisses ñ Seem to cool in the warmth of the sun ñ When I give my heart ñ It will be completely ñ Or I'll never give my heart ñ At the moment ñ I can feel that ñ You feel the same way too ñ Is when I fall in love ñ With you
Something wrong? ñ Now tell me what you're hiding ñ Deep inside you're boiling, you're ready to explode ñ Let's avoid it, now fight it, tell me please ñ Don't scorch me with a look, or torch me in your mind ñ I see the signs, ask what's the problem ñ You say nothing - meaning everything ñ That's my problem: every glance is accusation ñ Every breath a condemnation, isolation, paranoia ñ Sure I can feel it: three simple words ñ The war of silence
Do I worry 'cause you're stepping out ñ Do I worry 'cause you've got me in doubt ñ Though your kisses aren't right ñ Do I give a bag of beans ñ Do I stay home every night ñ And read my magazines ñ Am I frantic 'cause we've lost the spark ñ Is there panic when it starts turning dark ñ And when evening shadows creep ñ Do I lose any sleep over you ñ Do I worry, you can bet your life I do
Maybe I should have saved those leftover dreams ñ Funny but here's that rainy day ñ Here's that rainy day they told me about ñ And I laughed at the thought ñ That it might turn out this way ñ Where is that worn out wish that I threw aside ñ After it brought my love so near ñ Funny how love becomes a cold rainy day ñ Funny that rainy day is here ñ It's funny how love becomes a cold rainy day ñ Funny that rainy day is here
Love Ya Baby Mom ñ Look how far coming from ñ And I would do it all again
I know it's my fault ñ I gave up on everything ñ And I see you happy ñ It warms my heart, my heart ñ And we said ñ It's not the end ñ But she wore that white dress ñ And I changed ñ We are not the same ñ But I thought you'd wait, I thought you'd wait ñ You would wait ñ And we sat on my cold apartment floor ñ Where we thought we would stay in love ñ Stay in love
I have seen the devil's fires ñ All around the youth ñ I have seen the funeral pyres ñ Too much suicide ñ Jesus died, blood of christ ñ Don't heed the lies, of the evil side ñ Standing at the door of death ñ I have seen the light of heaven ñ My eternity ñ Realise, Christ, paid the price ñ Don't need to die, without eternal life
In this place, filled with empty space ñ Your love holds the key, baby sympathize with me ñ I need you ñ Before I lost, your touch of life and grace ñ I knew that your sweet face could always comfort me ñ I love you ñ In this place, full of empty space ñ Your soft and tender love will always shine for me ñ I love you ñ Now I know, what it means to have you gone ñ I'm down on my knees baby see by me ñ I love you
Afraid not to reach fame and fortune by the time I'm 44 ñ Had so many excuses ñ I choose you by the time I wanted some money more ñ Had to be on your list for sure babe ñ O Gimme your heart, boom boom, nobody gives a heart ñ I know that I should stay away from you, I know that I should stay away ñ I know that I should stay away but ñ Take me take me anyway (anywhere)
Wonderin' when I'll leave you for dead ñ Wonderin' falls like spare change through fat fingers ñ Ooohhh... ñ Get away  ñ Get away  ñ Get away  ñ Wonderin' when I'll leave you for dead ñ Wonderin' falls like spare change through fat fingers ñ Ooohhh... ñ Get away  ñ Get away  ñ Get away  ñ Yeah, yeah, yeah ñ Yaaaahhhh... ñ Ooohhh... ñ Ooohhh... ñ Get away  ñ Get away  ñ Get away 
I've put the past behind me ñ So I'll live with no regrets ñ Moved on to better things ñ Not my fault some can't accept ñ No - No regrets! ñ No - No regrets! ñ Now I'm so much strongwe ñ But I still will not forget ñ This time I'll be much wiser ñ 'cause I put myself in check ñ No - No regrets! ñ No - No regrets! ñ That was then, this is now ñ I've put the past behind me ñ That was then - This is now! ñ I live my life with no regrets!
I see a man out in the cold There's something there I see it in his eyes He ñ Wonders how to make it through the night and the days to come for the rest ñ Of his life ñ Reach for the sky Can't you hear me Can't you see me Reach for the sky So ñ Out of touch Why don't you reach for the sky ñ I see a tear Coming down from his eyes A cry for help Echoes in my head I ñ Wonder why He stands here all alone He reaches out for the rest of his life
Autumn leaves are flying, (each a baby's brittle boat) ñ The season's dying, (winter's mottled pigeon throat) ñ Sings the coo-cool air ñ The old sun's pale and rising, (write it down in yr little note) ñ He's pale and rising, (fold it up yr little note) ñ Waning, pale in the air ñ Autumn leaves are flying, (time to find yr winter coat) ñ To cease from crying... ñ Sing instead my little Vernoona
Some say, death is the easy way and I think they're right ñ Because nights tick, by like a long week except when you stop by ñ And I know that trying gets nothing done and I see you're about dry ñ Because nothing gets you high, you're poor the day you die ñ And alcohol it only makes you tired ñ But seeing you feels good, and its always understood ñ That anything much sweeter would make me die
I fell in love with a belly dancer
Chainsaw wielding maniac ñ Beheads victim with an axe ñ Grisly project will now start ñ Hunt for the remaining parts ñ Torso severed from the dead ñ Connecting the severed head ñ Arms lopped off, blood gushing red ñ Chainsaw severs hips and legs ñ Sewing on the body parts ñ Bloody work of human art ñ Human puzzle now complete ñ Ghastly display of bloody meat ñ Sick creation of dead flesh ñ Rips off your balls, you bleed to death
Oh wondrous, is this surrounding ñ Where gravity releases me ñ So that I may stay beneath ñ Ocean blue ñ Am I really what you seek? ñ Another nameless sailor's ghost ñ Lost to the sea ñ Oh, what have I become ñ A prodigal son ñ A mouth without a word to say ñ A question begging for an answer? ñ Open my eyes ñ To see the crystal blue ñ In the depths ñ You were still there ñ Oh, what have I become ñ A prodigal son ñ A mouth without a word to say? ñ When all is said and done ñ Will I reap what I've sown?
If there is another way ñ To save this life ñ Am I strong enough to push through the darkness ñ Into your light? ñ I should've known it was a lie ñ All this time ñ What I'd give if I could only see the world ñ Through your eyes?
Shine bright morning light ñ Now in the air the spring is coming ñ Sweet blowing wind ñ Singing down the hills and valleys ñ Keep your eyes on me ñ Now we're on the edge of hell ñ Dear my love sweet morning light ñ Wait for me you've gone much farther too far ñ Shine bright morning light ñ Now in the air the spring is coming ñ Sweet blowing wind ñ Singing down the hills and valleys ñ Keep your eyes on me ñ Now we're on the edge of hell ñ Dear my love sweet morning light ñ Wait for me you've gone much farther too far ñ Too far
Could you map this globe ñ With a torment slowly rose ñ To a fear resigned ñ Quiet room I hope I find ñ Cut me open please ñ Cut me open please ñ With an altar robe ñ I have stumbled knife to lobe ñ In compulsion drown ñ Counting every phantom found ñ Cut me open please ñ Cut me open please ñ Cut me open please ñ Cut me open please ñ With a bridge I've killed ñ I will serotonin fill ñ To a fear resigned ñ Quiet room I hope I find ñ Cut me open please ñ Cut me open please ñ Cut me open please ñ Cut me open please

Sometimes there isn't an answer ñ Sometimes there isn't a reason ñ Sometimes there's no explanation ñ For the unexplained ñ Sometimes no one is guilty ñ Sometimes there's no one to blame ñ Sometimes no one can be found ñ For the unexplained ñ For the unexplained ñ Sometimes you get given somethings ñ You not did wish for ñ It wasn't in the contract ñ For the unexplained ñ Sometimes this is not life ñ Sometimes this is not living ñ For the unexplained ñ For the unexplained

Horror in the graveyard - An evil hellish sight ñ Worm eaten corpses rising in the night ñ They're seeking human flesh, they live for nothing else ñ Once they come to you - You can't defend yourself ñ Out of the grave - Death is stalking you ñ You can't escape - You're eaten alive ñ They bite into your flesh ñ But you're still alive ñ You scream out a cry of agony and death ñ Your guts are devoured ñ Your bones are stripped of flesh ñ Your mangled fucking carcass ñ Lies in pools of blood
And speaking of torture ñ How 'bout this ugly son of a bitch

I don't know how can a woman ñ Do a man so wrong ñ She can run around all night ñ Don't never come home ñ I walk the streets all night ñ Looking for that girl of mine ñ Found her sloppy drunk ñ Down at the county line ñ (refrain) ñ Oh Lord so wrong (2) ñ OH LORD IT'S (?SHE'S?) too far gone ñ Had all I can stand ñ You know wrong's wrong ñ Someone's come up missing ñ I'll be long gone ñ Refrain ñ She's shaking on a leaf ñ Trailing on a tree ñ She can't look me in the face the way she's been doing me ñ Refrain
If you want a chance ñ At necromance ñ If you need spirits stirred ñ You must have a spark ñ You must know the dark ñ You must know the word ñ The word the word the word... ñ If you want to play ñ At God with clay ñ Like back in the day ñ They you must say ñ You just have to say ñ So let us say ñ The word the word the word... ñ Today ñ The word the word the word...

Alright everybody are you ready ñ I said are you ready ñ Alright, in his fifth recording ñ Live at the faith center ñ Everybody make some noise and welcome to the stage ñ Jonathan Nelson ñ Any fearless people in the house
We sat outside the studio at night ñ Among a few candles ñ And closed our eyes for a minute ñ After that ñ We jammed straight from our hearts ñ We didn't play for ourselves ñ But for the ones no longer with us in flesh ñ Nut always with us in spirit ñ God bless ñ Until we meet again ñ Soul fly... fly free!

Thought that i would understand ñ And hoped for you to follow on again ñ As the silver cup slips out of our hands ñ We shure know how it feels ñ From our heads down the heels ñ Skyblues on the losing end ñ Still hoping for that glory we'll pretend ñ The silver cup slipped out of our hands ñ Should'a known it wasn't meant for us ñ Now we're offensive while defending the loss

The stage is an open platform ñ I speak of personal conviction ñ Because of that I am a guest ñ Who's in charge ñ It's an open forum ñ Music is music ñ We're here to share what we know ñ Can we not coexist ñ Are there limits on being open minded ñ Are we a threat to you ñ It seems to be personal ñ But it doesn't have to be ñ Acceptance is a part of life ñ Tolerance is too ñ We're to help not corrupt

I'll have a blue Christmas without you ñ I'll be so blue just thinking about you ñ Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree ñ Won't be the same dear, if you're not here with me ñ And when those blue snowflakes start falling ñ That's when those blue memories start calling ñ You'll be doin' all right, with your Christmas of white ñ But I'll have a blue, blue blue blue Christmas ñ You'll be doin' all right, with your Christmas of white ñ But I'll have a blue, blue Christmas

Lyrics from snippet: ñ  ñ Tryna find a flame for my fire, can't bring it out ñ Smoke is caught in a fantasy ñ And now we are where we are right now ñ We found our way back to each other and turned it around ñ We'll build a hell of a family ñ That's where we are, where we are right now ñ  ñ On that bullshit (Ooh, ooh, ooh) ñ Miss me with the bullshit ñ On that bullshit ñ  ñ Oh, don't bring that back ñ You're just like me, you like to sleep around ñ I hate this feelin', just tryna get it right

On a day like today ñ We passed the time away ñ Writing love letters in the sand ñ How you laughed when I cried ñ Each time I saw the tide ñ Take our love letters from the sand ñ You made a vow that you would ever be true ñ But somehow that vow meant nothing to you ñ Now my broken heart aches ñ With every wave that breaks ñ Over love letters in the sand ñ Now my broken heart aches ñ With every wave that breaks ñ Over love letters in the sand
Now rise, now rise, now rise above the lies ñ And see the real devil in disguise ñ Be prepared to read between the lines ñ Wake up and see the shit with your own eyes ñ Face the truth and confront reality ñ Can't you see the evil eye of your society ñ Life is more than a "wife-car-house" dream ñ Face reality and one day you will see ñ Now rise above the lies ñ And see the shit with your own eyes!
perpetually paralyzed ñ kept within unkept frames of mind ñ ignorant or technically blind? ñ I have to make you realize ñ I have to make you realize ñ trickery, oh ñ stretched upon a table device ñ your hands screw the clamps on the vice ñ random ends of pins on the spine ñ I have to make you realize ñ I have to make you realize
You are in my heart ñ And I will always be there when you need me ñ Right back from the start ñ When I saw your eyes ñ Didn't know what came up in my mind ñ Cause I was really lost ñ And all that I could think of was
Heaven knows, what I know ñ There's no more, things to show ñ I think it's time to go ñ When I was, very young ñ Love was my, only drug ñ Now I want more and more ñ My feelings are rejected ñ I can't stay calm no more ñ I feel my mind affected ñ I start to lose my self control ñ All around, faces dazed ñ Everyone looks amazed ñ I just can't stand no more ñ All I see, fake efforts ñ Instead love, only words ñ Don't say I didn't warned
Finally it's so clear to me ñ W fragile life is ñ Truthfully the moment ñ Is all that's guaranteed ñ Only now I've realized ñ That time won't wait for me ñ No more can I hide ñ My feelings deep inside ñ Will we ever be more than fantasy? ñ Will we ever be sweet reality - you and me? ñ Patiently I've waited ñ For love to come to me ñ Clearly I've only ñ Seen what I want to see ñ Now it seems I've let all ñ My chances pass me by ñ No more can I hide ñ My feelings deep inside ñ Will we ever be...
Oh, the dream I have suffered ñ Augured fear upon the water ñ Vessels tall with small men inside ñ Coming near against the ebb tide ñ I can talk to fox like he's a man ñ I can pull a harvest from the sand ñ But I feel all time is ending ñ As it's east, the sun is setting
Haha, all right Apollo! ñ Let's hear it one more time for mister, Gary, Coleman! ñ Whatcha talk about Willis?

I become a possessed ñ I start shaking ñ The pentagram flames ñ Bring shine to my eyes ñ The sacred cross burning to call ñ For the sabbath beginning ñ The sacrifice acclaimed for all
No one ever kissed me the way that you do ñ And no one ever told me"I love you" ñ No one ever cared ñ No, no one ever shared ñ All those dreams that I dreamed would come true ñ (2nd verse) ñ No one ever hurt me the way that you do ñ "Cause no one ever broke my heart in two ñ But I'll keep on caring my whole life through ñ For no one,no one but you ñ (repeat 2nd verse)
Danny Diamond, she was a star ñ She took the stage every quarter hour ñ She was a hottest gig in town, in fact ñ She was the hottest girl around ñ She had the strut, she had the lines ñ To make a man's heart go 'round about ñ She put it all into her act until ñ One night after the show ñ Danny gyrated, wouldn't you know ñ Something had to go ñ Down she smack, it was her back ñ Completely crack, so fade to black ñ So ends the act of Danny Diamond ñ She was a star
I thought about you again today
May the path that i walk be the path of righteousness ñ May the words from my mouth give you praise ñ May my heart be your home and a place of holiness ñ I worship you in love ñ I lift you, lift you up ñ  ñ Alle, alleluia to the father to the lord ñ Alle alleluia to the savior forevermore
Slaves give birth to slaves ñ In a vile rite of pain and ash ñ When vanity is stripped away ñ Brutal force becomes authority ñ The nation state is a giant grave ñ The rule is endless insanity ñ Perpetual cancer hissing forth ñ Its independence is a shackle to the soul ñ Feeble breed for war and plague ñ Population rooted in shame ñ Its end without end
Fucking pigs ñ On the loose ñ Lawless law ñ Excess force ñ Lock down ñ Oppress ñ Uniformed ñ With a badge ñ With an itch ñ To fuck you
Summer fades ñ Winter's cold hands embrace me ñ When will this world need me? I've forgotten everything, everything, that's important to me ñ Right now I'm just holding pictures ñ Painting a memory of a love I used to believe, used to believe ñ Sitting watching it all pass in silence; this can't be what I need ñ This is a winter I'll never last ñ This is isolation I can't stand ñ Beyond my thoughts there is a hope that lies within, a hope that lies within ñ Enthroned in isolation
I will temper my spirit ñ With(out you) ñ My desire with information ñ And in this way we'll carry away ñ I will not give up on you ñ  that will grow lighter ñ Until it grows in (this heaven)
Nothing's prettier than Rose is ñ She's the sunshine of my day ñ Nothing's prettier than Rose is ñ She's my everything to say ñ Rose has always been a plain me ñ They say beauty once was her desire ñ Rose to me has so much altere ñ One look in her eyes sets me on fire ñ Nothing's prettier than Rose is... ñ Rose will always be my special one ñ She got much more than I deserve ñ Rose will always be my morning sun ñ She mends my strength and gives me nerve ñ Nothing's prettier than Rose is...
Why don't we arrange ñ Time for you to come and see ñ 'Cause I can't wait but a little bit longer ñ I can't wait but a little bit longer ñ We can't wait but a little bit longer ñ Can't you see that all the things around us changing? ñ Of course you've seen them changing ñ We can't wait but a little bit longer ñ We can't wait but a little bit longer
Deserts of vast eternity ñ From which I cannot escape ñ Oh, woe be upon me ñ The pain of solitude ñ Choirs of damnation ñ Chanting in my dreams ñ 'Life shall be no more ñ Life - thou shalt diea ñ Not shall the knife ñ Sleep in my hand ñ I lament and bewail ñ As my soul withers ñ Alone I wander ñ This be the fate I choose ñ An inner, desolate void ñ I shall fear no more

Hello everybody ñ To whom this may be of interest ñ A particular word ñ Or prioritize ñ Let's create a pact of  ñ Griefly misunderstanding ñ Misrepresented and confided ñ Misrepresented and confided ñ Working directly in Transport ñ Was probably more exciting and fun to watch in the movies ñ But really, such strange people ñ Music's slow dances were so pure
Amazing grace, how sweet the sound ñ That saved a wretch like me ñ I once, I once was lost, oh, now am found ñ I was blind, oh, but now I see ñ Through many dangers, toils and snares ñ I have, I have already, already come ñ T'was grace that brought me safe this far ñ And grace shall lead me home ñ Our world shall soon dissolve like snow ñ The sun forbear to shine ñ But God, who called me here, here below ñ Will be forever mine
No no there is no proof of terroristic government claims ñ The terror alert the terror alert on high ñ Democracy spreads one missle at a time
I thought you'd try ñ I thought you'd try to stay ñ Thought you'd want to work it out ñ Maybe we are ñ Working it out alone ñ But this house don't feel like home ñ With just me and all these songs
Sound ñ A vibration ñ An audible wave ñ A sensation ñ I only wanna live forever ñ I only vibe together ñ And we can go on and on and on and on and on ñ Eternally ñ I only wanna live forever ñ I only vibe together ñ And we can go on and on and on and on and on ñ Eternally
If I laugh just a little bit ñ Maybe I can forget the chance ñ That I didn't have to know you ñ And live in peace, in peace ñ If I laugh just a little bit ñ Maybe I can forget the plans that ñ I didn't use to get you ñ At home with me alone ñ If I laugh just a little bit ñ Maybe I can recall the way ñ That I used to be, before you ñ And sleep at night and dream ñ If I laugh, baby if I laugh ñ Just a little bit

Sweet September, I remember ñ Eyes of August deepest blue ñ While the lazy town was sleeping ñ Strangest love that I ever knew ñ Feel the wind blow, see the shadows ñ Kiss the breeze of a sudden shore ñ Of my life's loves and fascinations ñ The only one who left me wanting more ñ Little blonde plaits ñ Drink to you love, drink to me love ñ Sun burned feet on a dusty track ñ Evening waves that turned in twilight ñ Caught forever those little blonde plaits

(Efthimis Karadimas/Nightfall 1997) ñ I've standed between east and west ñ I've made friends the south and the north ñ The charmy sea now I call as a nest ñ The precious ground offers me strength and growth ñ One God, No Godess ñ On eground, no sea ñ Death jealoused your beauty ñ And stole you from me ñ Strange nature, cold as ice ñ So warm for me, your touch, your eyes ñ White in black and black in white ñ This furious spirit once has my bride
Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December ñ But the days grow short when you reach September ñ When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame ñ One hasn't got time for the waiting game ñ Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few ñ September, November ñ And these few precious days I'll spend with you ñ These precious days I'll spend with you
Vibration, your vibration ñ My vibration, your vibration ñ The vibe that I feel from you ñ It is the same that is born from me
I would never dream ñ Of blaming it on you ñ So please don't ask me ñ To stay any longer ñ Anymore ñ An odd but deep calm ñ Washes over me ñ And from this distance ñ I take in the heat from the glow ñ From your burning skin ñ  ñ It was never supposed to happen to worms like you ñ To worms like you
Lie to me if you will ñ At the top of Barringer Hill ñ Tell me anything you want ñ Any old lie will do ñ Call me back to, back to you ñ  ñ Lie to me if you will ñ At the top of Barringer Hill ñ Tell me anything you want ñ Any old fraud will do ñ Call me back to, back to you
If you want, I will love you ñ I'll open my cupboard and show you my jumpers ñ And posters and you'll say, "Don't be afraid, I'll fall overboard" ñ I'm made of ivory, I'm a cannonball ñ What have you done? ñ You're not a weapon, are you? ñ  ñ I last forever, I have plenty time ñ Make marks, I do not panic ñ Don't be afraid, I've been here before ñ I'm made of ivory, I eat cannibals ñ I'll tie you up, I'll sail on by, I will ñ  ñ Oh, oh, oh, oh ñ Oh, oh, oh, oh ñ Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I wish I took you away from your problems and your worthless life. I would have forced you to leave the pills, the bottles behind. I just wanted you to be as free as me and see the world the way it was meant to be. Now 6 feet deep and nowhere to go. No life, no future and no one to hold. 20 years of life shut down by substances of waste. No laughs, no smiles, only these tears of shame. Dead. You threw your life away. Dead. I wish I took you away
Hate paper doll ñ You never get cut, but you're looking at me ñ Hate paper doll ñ You never get back, but you never can see ñ Taking it all, cut from a sack that you ñ Got on TV ñ Paid for it all, taking it back 'cause ñ I wanted it free ñ Wanted it free now, you say ñ You want it to be ñ Just like me now
Lyrics from Snippet
To glance upon oneself ñ Reflects self loathing inside ñ All emotions left on the shelf ñ With inner fears left to hide ñ This darkness that lingers ñ And the cold consumes you ñ Through the dark long winter ñ A past which I once knew ñ Never to gaze, never to indulge ñ To give oneself... completely ñ A vulnerable state to divulge ñ Better to store away neatly ñ As the mirror distorts all perceptions inside ñ All is revealed within the void
When raindrops fell down from the sky ñ The day you left me, an angel cried ñ Oh, she cried ñ An angel cried, she cried
The stars grow dim ñ In their places ñ And the moon turns pale ñ Before me ñ Veils are blown ñ Across its flame ñ Demons approach the circumference ñ Of my sanctuary ñ A wind has risen ñ The dark water stirs ñ And they like the dark places best ñ For their god is a lying lord ñ Strange lines appear carved on my door ñ The light from the window ñ Grows increasingly dim ñ At death's door ñ You will find your redemption ñ And there will ñ Always remain a black earth ñ Helvete
I demand you all in my attention ñ I say what I want ñ I want a standing ovation at my funeral ñ For miles to be seen ñ From beyond the limousines ñ And laughter to be from miles around ñ Smiling faces and for everyone to stand in my attention ñ Now repeat after me when I say ñ "I will live forever" ñ Now you say "I will live forever"...
Racing from my head forever ñ Staring wildly as in like a feather blowing ñ Take me through an open window ñ Maybe we could play a part and not know we played it ñ They're hanging like the hours ñ That move with hidden powers ñ Take me to a silken shadow ñ Maybe we could play a part and not know we played it
She was opening up an elevator ñ On a rainy day ñ Sitting on a little stool ñ And looking far away ñ  ñ When I asked if she would like to take me ñ To another floor ñ She laughed and said she probably would ñ And then she closed the door
Translated title: Hope
The other side of time (is coming!) ñ Yes, I feel so fine ñ I feel real in my head ñ Oh, I feel so fine ñ We wanna feel so fine! ñ FINE! ñ The other side of time (how far is good!?) ñ Oh I feel so fine ñ I feel heat in my head ñ My feet are flying ñ We wanna feel so fine! ñ Yes, I feel so fine ñ I feel real in my head ñ Oh, I feel so fine ñ We wanna feel so fine! ñ Yes, I feel so fine ñ I feel space in my head ñ Move your body beat ñ We wanna feel so fine! ñ We wanna feel so fine!

When you grow tired of bein' pretty when you grow older and pay your dues ñ When you grow tired of too much living honey I'll take care of you ñ I'll make good for you I'll take care of you ñ When you grow tired of bein' young and all your songs are sung ñ Honey I'll take care of you ñ When you grow tired of spending evenings placing twilight to the dew ñ When you grow tired of wealthy people honey I'll take care of you ñ I'll make good for you... ñ Honey I'll take care of you
In your room ñ I'm in your head now ñ Can you feel it? ñ Can you feel this smelling your hair? ñ It's okay that you're the answer that i can't seem to formulate ñ Are you claustrophobic? ñ Blood is the new fashion ñ When your face shatters like porcelain bullets ñ Wounds gape like open sewers ñ It's okay ñ This is what they're doing in europe ñ Strangling flowers into ocean blue ñ You're the rock and i'm the roll ñ So tilt your gaping neck and let the good times flow

Quite a surprise.... What an ingenious device ñ Boredom encompassesmy time. I don't know what I should do ñ Indulging a moment of your time. Seldom the breeder of lies ñ But you won't believe that it's true ñ They take to the sky ñ Southbound Pachyderm ñ Pinholes through cardboard at the sun ñ Passing the bucks by one by one, leaving nothing in return ñ Watching the majsety blow past. Speculating which will be the last ñ Savoring my piece of pie ñ And there is no reprise ñ They take to the sky ñ Southbound Pachyderm

When the last page is turned ñ And the wick's completely burned ñ You won't even know I left your side ñ I'll envy your new place ñ With lots of running space ñ 'til you wake you'll have a place to hide ñ Sweet dreams, sweet dreams ñ You may run out of room ñ From old mcgregor's broom ñ Peter is your old protective friend ñ Fright may wake your eyes ñ And night leaves you surprised ñ You can come next door and crawl on in ñ Sweet dreams, sweet dreams ñ Sweet dreams, sweet dreams
Yo DJ Kwestion on the one's and two's. On the zigga-zigga. Always holdin' me down. Wild music coming this year, yo, wild music. Jus Allah - Meanest Man Alive. Army of the Pharoahs - In Blood Reborn. New Outerspace. New Vinnie Paz. New Ill Bill - The Grimey Awards. New Heavy Metal Kings. Hittin' y'all in the head. It don't fuckin' stop. Hard body rap
Those that forever disappear ñ All I want is for you to talk to me ñ The way you used to do ñ Your old hymns don't touch my face ñ My heart moves in a new place ñ I am out of practice falling into love ñ Remember when we used to say ñ "I don't know" and it was okay ñ I am going back to knowing nothing now ñ Those that forever disappear ñ All I want is for you to talk to me ñ The way you used to do ñ If you won't be seen again ñ I hope you know you were my friend ñ And in my head the world will never hurt you
Who left the lights on Julian? ñ Make promises, broke them enough for being said ñ Who left the lights on Julian? ñ They come, waking the whole house up ñ  ñ You've been longing for....wake them up ñ You've been longing for being too honest ñ Aiming without a cause ñ  ñ Who left the lights on Julian? ñ Make promises, broke them enough ñ Who left the lights on Julian?
Wanna go get high? ñ Mercury is parked outside ñ Under the light ñ Wanna take me to ñ The parking lot of the old high school? ñ  ñ And it's like you said ñ Would've turned up dead in the car ñ And it's like you said ñ Would've turned up dead in the car ñ  ñ Wanna go get high? ñ Mercury is parked outside ñ Under the light ñ Wanna take me to ñ The parking lot of the old high school? ñ  ñ And it's like you said ñ Would've turned up dead in the car ñ And it's like you said ñ Would've turned up dead in the car
I am not who you think I am ñ I am not who you've made me to be ñ My pedestal is decayed with sin ñ Collapsing al around me ñ With all your expectations ñ With all your preconceptions ñ The straw man ñ I am ñ Not called to be ñ Your idea ñ Of how you see me ñ I am not in a place to pretend ñ To be a fake version of a man ñ The straw man ñ I am ñ Not called to be ñ Your idea ñ Of how you see me ñ Not called to be ñ Of how you see ñ How you see me
The sands of time ñ The sands of time will tell ñ Hearts and our minds ñ These things you know so well ñ The sands of time ñ The sands of time will tell ñ Healing or dying ñ These things you know so well ñ The sands of time ñ The sands of time will tell ñ Hearts and our minds ñ These things you know so well
The timeless waves, bright, sifting, broken glass, ñ Came dazzling around, into the rocks, ñ Came glinting, sifting from the Americas ñ To posess Aran. Or did Aran rush ñ to throw wide arms of rock around a tide ñ That yielded with an ebb, with a soft crash? ñ Did sea define the land or land the sea? ñ Each drew new meaning from the waves' collision. ñ Sea broke on land to full identity.
Memory, hither come ñ And tune your merry notes; ñ And while upon the wind ñ Your music floats ñ I'll pore upon the stream ñ Where sighing lovers dream ñ And fish for fancies as they pass ñ Within the watery glass ñ I'll drink of the clear stream ñ And hear the linnet's song ñ And there I'll lie and dream ñ The day along; ñ And when night comes I'll go ñ To places fit for woe ñ Walking along the darkened valley ñ With silent melancholy
My name Jeff ñ  ñ I know ñ That it would be ñ So nice
Where there once was only hurt ñ He gave His healing hand ñ Where there once was only pain ñ He brought comfort like a friend ñ I feel the sweetness of His love ñ Piercing my darkness ñ I see the bright and morning sun ñ As it ushers in His joyful gladness! ñ  ñ He's turned my mourning into dancing again ñ He's lifted my sorrows, I can't stay silent ñ I must sing for His joy has come ñ  ñ His anger lasts for a moment in time ñ But His favor is here and will be on me ñ For all my lifetime!
Highway there Spark it Baby Baby ñ Tension Suddenly Outer Spacy ñ There's a wallet on my ass with a ñ Rock 'n' Roll License ñ Jet Generation ñ Barely Barely Bang Bang ñ Make it Flashy Riding too hard ñ Go go go next with Jet GO GO GO! ñ Born in Haneda ñ Jet Timing always in his head ñ Weather Forecast don't mean a thing ñ Jet order - Bet your life!! ñ Jet Generation ñ Jet Generation Jet Generation ñ Jet Generation Jet Generation ñ Jet Generation Jet Generation ñ Jet Generation Jet Generation
A fune I ka kene ñ A fune I ka kene ñ Drown in the waterfall ñ Heart, body, spirit and soul ñ Unbelievable ñ All of the heartache is gone ñ I heard the calling ñ Calling me home ñ African haunting love ñ A fune I ka kene ñ A fune I ka kene ñ Down the river goes ñ Healing, confucius at once ñ Unbelievable ñ I thought I'd never get to see god ñ Et il nous visitera demain, tu sais ñ Et il nous donnera des saluts deux
Hey, hey, when I jump, you say ñ Hey hey, when I jump, you say ñ I-I-I-It's the music ñ Hey, hey ñ That's when I blow blow ñ That's when I blow blow ñ That's when I blow blow ñ That's when I blow blow ñ That's when I blow blow ñ That's when I blow blow ñ That's when I blow blow ñ That's when I blow blow ñ You say
Burning in the cold ñ Bursting in the bright ñ We lose the breeze tonight ñ Reading in the bold ñ Charming as the flies under bite ñ We've lost life support, overnight ñ Umbilical cables, medic mites ñ Utopia, one more ta-da, Utopia ñ We're on the outs with the ins ñ And all the needles with the pins ñ Burn the flame alive ñ Of splintered pores ñ Dental damn ñ Broken doors ñ Utopia, one more ta-da, Utopia ñ Burning in the cold
Out of luck ñ Times are rough, I guess I'm fucked ñ That's no joke ñ Guess I'll fight and that's no lie ñ I'll fight ñ Rise above ñ Break my silence on your head ñ I don't know ñ I can't blow that smoke, I'll choke ñ Feast or die ñ Chew the fat of life and smile ñ Time to fly ñ Spread my wings, I choose to ride ñ Spread my wings
Lyrics from Snippet ñ  ñ How will I reach those years? (Those years) ñ Why didn't I just go here? (Go here) ñ All this shit that is on my face (On my face) ñ And all these ashes I can take (These ashes I can take) ñ  ñ Need it burned away ñ Burned away ñ Burned away ñ I need it burned away
For all we know ñ We may never meet again ñ Before you go ñ Make this moment ñ Sweet to give ñ We won't say goodnight ñ Until the last minute ñ I'll hold out my hand ñ And my heart ñ Will be in it ñ For all we know ñ This may only be a dream ñ We come and we go ñ Like a river or a stream ñ So love me tonight ñ Tomorrow was made for some ñ Tomorrow may never come ñ For all we know ñ Solo ñ So love me tonight ñ Tomorrow was made for some ñ Tomorrow may never come ñ For all we know

Joy is mine come morning time ñ It's set in and here to stay ñ I can be myself nowadays ñ Jesus is my help nowadays ñ All is fine come evening time ñ I just used to pine away ñ I can be myself nowadays ñ Jesus is my help nowadays ñ Life is mine, eternal kind ñ But now is the time to say ñ I can be myself nowadays ñ Jesus is my help nowadays
Actions make history ñ And we can play our part ñ There is nothing to lose now ñ Let the heavens free ñ Risk ñ Risk it ñ Over the borders (risiko!) ñ Against the rules (risiko!) ñ Play with fire (risiko!) ñ And life will be a daring adventure ñ Lauf! ñ Many actions ñ Many questions ñ Much can happen still ñ New strivings, new beginnings ñ Life must go on still ñ Actions
Two seconds to realize your pain ñ Two seconds it's more that what you say ñ Two seconds the hell is in your life ñ Two seconds, two seconds ñ This is the life ñ Open up your eyes ñ The life... ñ Open up your eyes ñ Two seconds to live your life again ñ Two seconds it's less that what you say ñ Two seconds time is running fast ñ Two seconds, two seconds ñ This is the life ñ Open up your eyes ñ The life... ñ Open up your eyes ñ Tick tack, tick tack... this is the life...
The lie is so real, I almost believe it ñ Conceit flows like sewage ñ How could you conceive it? ñ Shake my hand, look me in the eye ñ Smile and think of ways I'll die ñ Plastic bomb, plastic smile ñ Fake commitment, blood soaked style ñ Wrapped in a fur, trapped in a cancer ñ The swansong's over for the littlest dancer ñ Mistrust so explosive, apathetic corrosive ñ When I ask for it straight up ñ False face is compulsive ñ Try to stand tall, falling face down ñ Big fish, Small town, Small fish, Ghost town
I don't live alone ñ I have two children and a wife ñ When the day folds over ñ I don't have much extra time ñ In my middle age ñ I do the math on give versus take ñ And it still holds true that nothing lost is nothing gained ñ Save me from myself and love me ñ Like a child needs love ñ And a structure to their day ñ I see it all before me ñ Laid out in the simplest way ñ In the modern age ñ My addictions have me caged ñ And the social posturing ñ I feel cynical and vain ñ Save me from myself and love me
A sunbonnet blue and a yellow straw hat ñ Shy little he and she ñ Were declaring love's old story ñ In the shade of the old apple tree ñ A sunbonnet blue and a yellow straw hat ñ Decided to say, "I do" ñ So they rode to June and glory ñ On a bicycle built for two ñ Hear the past, the song is old ñ The summer days are through ñ With silver threads among the gold ñ They still say, "I love you" ñ A sunbonnet blue and a yellow straw hat ñ Are true to this very day ñ For he loves her in December ñ As he did in May
Doesn't play a factor when you're at my side ñ Underneath the moonlight you open my sky ñ And you open my mind ñ So bright ñ As the stars in the distance collide ñ Spilling onto the canvas of souls ñ For a reason beyond our control ñ Mind ñ And you open my mind ñ Girl you open my sky ñ And you open my mind ñ So wide
The once lilly-white collar ñ Stained with sodomized blood ñ Molested children. Image of Purity ñ Soiled. Still blinded by their inbred ñ Faith they pay you rape their young
(backwards message) ñ Just once or twice is good for your soul ñ Praise God, brothers and sisters! ñ Accept Jesus in your heart and you will be saved! ñ You will receive everlasting life! ñ Listen to me, I've sinned, I know ñ Praise Jesus and you will be saved, saved! ñ Praise God and you are healed, healed, healed!

Nobody ever warns you ñ Or tells you what to do ñ She walks away ñ You're left to stay ñ Alone ñ Forever blue ñ The stars have all stopped shining ñ The sun just won't break through ñ Each day's the same ñ More clouds, more rain ñ You're left forever blue ñ Forever blue 'cause you love her ñ But she doesn't love you ñ You did your best ñ Life did the rest ñ You're left forever blue ñ No reason left for living ñ Still, theres a lot to do ñ Old songs to sing ñ New tears to cry ñ And feel forever blue ñ And be forever... ñ Blue
Disintegration of my life ñ I must say, I was revived ñ The air is thick, there is no light ñ I must say, I want it back ñ Back to bright ñ  ñ The separation feels so real ñ I must say, I want it bad ñ The air is thick, there is no light ñ I must say, I want it back ñ Back to bright ñ  ñ Disintegration of my life ñ I must say ñ The sky feels dark, there is no light ñ Yeah

Hey, let's all go into the forest ñ Nobody will notice for a while ñ There we can visit all the creatures ñ Maybe they can teach us facts of life ñ  ñ Or we can travel to the ocean ñ Don't forget your lotion ñ It's quite hot ñ I once met seven lovely crabs ñ They said I should go back and join them for tea ñ  ñ Oh wait, the forest got demolished ñ When they built the airport years ago ñ But we can still go see the ocean ñ Cause they put it in a bowl at the mall
Have you ever looked into the eyes of a lost soul ñ It seems like they have no hope at all? ñ Can you not see the pain of a blind man ñ Can you taste the fear, when he takes a stand ñ They run, they hide, they live, they die ñ They run, they hide, they live, and they die ñ Never knowing the reasons why ñ They were sent to earth, sent to earth to die ñ Still never knowing the reasons ñ So why don't you tell me? ñ Come back to me

Is you is or is you ain't my baby? ñ Well, the way you're acting lately, well it makes me doubt ñ You were still my baby, baby ñ But it seems like my flame in your heart, well it's just gone out ñ A man is a creature ñ That has always been strange ñ Just when you're sure of one ñ You'll find that he's gone and made a change ñ Is you is or is you ain't my baby? ñ Well, maybe my baby found somebody new ñ Or is my baby still my baby too?
Your god is your chains ñ Reject your god, reject your system ñ Do you really want your freedom?
Wake up wanting but don't know what ñ Night rider waiting ñ How can you still be on my mind? ñ The truth is overrated too ñ  ñ Something about the way you held me tonight ñ Something about the way you kiss ñ No one can be blamed ñ We're the light arrived ñ Something we can't heal this time ñ  ñ Faux suede drifter, you never moved ñ Silence eroded ñ Touching you with a loaded gun ñ The eyes follow eyes and assume
I'm going back through time ñ Before the war this crime ñ Who would have believed ñ That they would do it ñ One April morning ñ Without a warning ñ The sirens woke us up ñ Two minutes to live we got ñ I'm dying I'm crying ñ Still I'm the lord ñ I'm fighting denying ñ Still I'm the lord ñ Of the wasteland ñ Now I'm alone here ñ The last man on earth I'll be ñ Walking through chaos land ñ There's just black mist and sand ñ I'm dying I'm crying ñ Still I'm the lord ñ I'm fighting denying ñ Still I'm the lord ñ Of the wasteland
A long cold stare is making its way ñ The sun is shining all the same, save all your prayers ñ Pretend to be waiting for me ñ Wasted infinity ñ  ñ Fall asleep to other people's songs ñ Kill the lights only to escape the day ñ And in the end it all comes down ñ To waking up where you belong
My morning brings the sun ñ But little does she know ñ The day would have begun anyway ñ  ñ And she sees the moon in every corner of the room ñ  ñ My darkness brings the stars ñ But little does she know ñ The night is never far anyway ñ  ñ And she sees the moon in every corner of the room ñ And says it's coming soon to every corner of the room ñ And she sees the moon in every corner of the room ñ And says it's coming soon to every corner of the room

Luther, a monk whose conscience ñ Wouldn't bow to the will of a man ñ The bible that he read ñ Didn't jive with the catholic brand ñ And the foolish empire told him to shut it down ñ They said, "how can faith alone save your soul?" ñ Liars, succession of the papacy ñ Became a god and ruled many well ñ If you get the pope and not the lord ñ You're gonna golden calf an idol to hell ñ Just like the lying prophets ñ Deception they prophesied for cash ñ Selling dead indulgence, wolves in woolly sash
Creation of light ñ Choked by a pole in the ground ñ Captures of light ñ Become inerted ñ In the lowest darkest pit ñ I feel them crawl ñ Through my darkest hate and spit ñ I see them fall ñ Nightmoon on the hunt to dominate ñ Shades moving faster than fire ñ Since the dawn of shadow men ñ Faster than fire ñ Faster than light ñ An outcast obsessed by shadows ñ Crippled, weeping, gnashing of teeth ñ Night terror ñ The sun has been blocked ñ Crippled by darkness ñ Burning despair ñ From the shadow keeper ñ Night terror

I don't really need to be the way I are ñ I don't really need to always go so far ñ I could get by on being alive but having no life ñ I don't really need a fuel infected car ñ I don't really need (or want) to be some kind of star ñ I could get by on being alive but having no life ñ You don't really know what it is you ask ñ All that I want is to find some peace at last ñ Take it further ñ Ride the tiger ñ (ride the tiger poem: geoff bird)
And now you've gone away ñ I begged you baby please don't go ñ Away and leave me here ñ I am broken I am broken ñ And I know ñ Winter is bearing down ñ On wings of Angels so your soul ñ Is in the hands of God ñ My tears on the wind
Eight miles high and when you touch down ñ You'll find that it's stranger than known ñ Signs in the street that say where you're going ñ Are somewhere just being their own ñ Nowhere is there warmth to be found ñ Among those afraid of losing their ground ñ Rain gray town known for its sound ñ In places small faces unbound ñ Round the squares huddled in storms ñ Some laughing some just shapeless forms ñ Sidewalk scenes and black limousines ñ Some living, some standing alone
I bet yo man a'in
Make up your mind ñ I said my prayers ñ Cold's taking over ñ Bringing frozen tears ñ The great silence ñ It's all said and done ñ You wanted too much ñ And now you have none ñ I was the price you paid ñ Hope you're happy now ñ Did you think twice before ñ Cutting my soul in half
You'd be so easy to love ñ Easy to idolize all others above ñ So worth the yearning for ñ So swell to keep the home fire burning for ñ We'd be so grand at the game ñ So carefree together, that it does seem a shame ñ That you can't see your future with me ñ 'Cause you'd be so easy to love
For many a year ñ This face of sullen tears ñ Look down, you left her here ñ In a room of sanguine mirrors ñ It's carved and it strays ñ This path it deviates ñ A walk, a dive, a wade ñ Into waters of the darkest age ñ But in a silent way, the hand it takes ñ Circling around, the birth, the mouth ñ It's stolen and untrue, this mark in you ñ And soon it will be found, left to drown ñ For many a year ñ This face of sullen tears ñ Look down, you left her here ñ In a room of sanguine mirrors
I know ñ Nothing ever keeps you safe for sure ñ No one ever dug down so far, we'd go ñ When heroes dropped their bombs outside ñ No one ever knew I made it ñ No one ever ñ  ñ Oh, bury us alive ñ Oh, bury us alive ñ Oh, bury us alive ñ Oh, bury us alive ñ  ñ Below, nothing ever grows ñ I'd come to see I'd froze ñ No one even noticed 'til I climbed and saw ñ The new world clouded out the sun ñ No one ever learned ñ (I see a touch of death to set me free) ñ  ñ Oh, bury us alive ñ Oh, bury us alive ñ Oh, bury us alive ñ Oh, bury us alive
So, maybe I assume is that ñ All the things I felt was out of mind ñ Am I out of mind? ñ Second guessing things you did ñ Making up excuses is in your head, uh ñ And I don't know why so ñ  ñ I, I gotta keep pushing out ñ You, you give me your reasons , baby ñ And I'm not , my love ñ All that you done, all you done, oh ñ I left you with a piece of my mind ñ I left you with a piece of my mind ñ I left you with a piece of my mind, oh
Wake up wake up ñ The dream is not over ñ Wake up wake up ñ Siren's call ñ (Instrumental) ñ  ñ Let my heart be far from you ñ I still hear the voice that screams ñ The song that enchanted me ñ I do not want to be far away ñ I will swim just to be closer ñ  ñ What you see, What you feel ñ What you did, What you hear ñ  ñ Give it now, wake up now ñ It's the Siren's Call ñ Awake at night and day ñ The Siren's voice resonates ñ It's the Siren's Call ñ (Instrumental)
A sunbonnet blue and a yellow straw hat ñ Shy little he and she ñ Were declaring love's old story ñ In the shade of the old apple tree ñ A sunbonnet blue and a yellow straw hat ñ Decided to say, "I do" ñ So they rode to June and glory ñ On a bicycle built for two ñ Hear the past, the song is old ñ The summer days are through ñ With silver threads among the gold ñ They still say, "I love you" ñ A sunbonnet blue and a yellow straw hat ñ Are true to this very day ñ For he loves her in December ñ As he did in May
I'm free, I'm free ñ And freedom tastes of reality ñ I'm free, I'm free ñ And I'm waiting for you to follow me ñ If I told you what it takes to reach the highest high ñ You'd laugh and say, "Nothing's that simple" ñ But you've been told many times before ñ Messiahs pointed to the door ñ No one had the guts to leave the temple ñ I'm free, I'm free ñ And freedom tastes of reality ñ I'm free, I'm free ñ And I'm waiting for you to follow me ñ How can we follow? ñ How can we follow?
OK, now come to a dead stop ñ One, two, three, four
I don't know what to believe ñ I don't know what to think ñ After an hour I'm left ñ A head full of facts to connect ñ Wait, take some time to explain ñ While keeping me up to date ñ Now I know everything ñ Just tell me what does it mean ñ Hey, who says crime doesn't pay? ñ It's selling well every day ñ I get the pictures thanks ñ But I'm still drawing a blank ñ Go from 3-D down to one ñ Acting deaf, blind and dumb ñ You transmit but don't receive ñ Just tell me what does it mean
What Have I done I have gone too far ñ I can't look back from this shooting star ñ Butt I'll say it's so sad ñ And I'll say ñ What you going to do when I'm gone ñ What you going to do when ñ What you going to do when I'm gone ñ What you going to do when ñ I live my life in a pack of lies ñ I must seek the truth once before i die ñ And I'll say it was sad ñ And I'll say ñ What you going to do when I'm gone ñ What you going to do when ñ What you going to do when I'm gone ñ What you going to do when
Can't afford to lose myself trying to be somebody else

You know what? I heard something not long ago ñ And now it echoes, it bothers me ñ It makes me sick, it proves your filth ñ I know your secrets ñ You aren't a model for a demon ñ Mend your wounds, your lies are bleeding ñ Convince someone else ñ Of your shoveled in confidence ñ Buried away, but I know, and if I had my way ñ A thousand eyes would witness ñ You point your finger at me ñ With one foot in your grave, liar
"X-Ray Delta 1, this is the Mission control... Roger, you're one-niner-three-zero..." ñ Things are changing ñ But nothing changes ñ And still there are changes ñ Le roi est mort, vive le roi
I am cat-like ñ I can prowl and pounce all night ñ I am cat-like ñ I can climb to any height ñ But when I finally reach the top ñ And realize I can't get down ñ I need some help ñ A little help ñ I am cat-like ñ Perfect vision, light or dark ñ I am cat-like ñ I don't do tricks nor do I bark ñ I have impeccable agility and balance ñ I am independent ñ But sometimes I need some help ñ A little help ñ I need some help ñ A little help
Leo, leo, leo, leo, leo, Leonie ñ Joe, joe, joe, joe, joe, joe, joe, joe, joe, joe, Joana ñ I don't, I don't, I don't wanna go to the party ñ Without, without you, without you begging me ñ O Contest Winner, my veil is growing thinner ñ I'd rather be a bird and kiss dogs ñ Than have your word engraved on a log ñ Cause I'm no nuisance ñ I'm void and truant ñ No need for a re-test ñ I know I'm a genius ñ Leonie is my sister ñ And I miss her ñ Joana is my sister ñ And I miss her
There's choking confusion, the blink of an eye. The clock has stopped and I give up trying to reason. Why do you do this to me? Only inside I see your concealting plan for me ñ Come on up little girl, you'd better push on, you've fallen. Send me to pick you up sensing defeat. Trapdoor open. This is the last time we try ñ Some little rumour grabs a gun by the handle, puts one finger on the trigger and it's shooting for me, and it's shooting from the ship ñ This is the last time we try
Diamonds ayy ñ  ñ Dripping the water the shorter
Building wealth on the backs of the poor ñ Making deals is sleazy smoke rooms ñ Politicians living feathered beds ñ Turn around and tax us to our deaths ñ We're living in a slave state ñ The left and right working in tune ñ Making sure they're the only two ñ Sharing power corruption greed and wealth ñ Keeping it all held tighly to their chests ñ Children smuggling guns into their schools ñ Teachers barred from enforcing any rules ñ Liars causing racial conflict wars ñ And the poor set firmly in their line
Break me down, fuck me over ñ It's just a matter of time ñ "used and abused" says the look in my eyes ñ The world is full of shitty people, it can't be denied ñ Laughing hard, crying harder, these are the days ñ I'm through trying to hide..."fuck these days" ñ It's the anthem of our youth... ñ The pretty need not apply ñ I'm through with the pain ñ So where do we go from here?
I wanna see you ñ Dressed in black again ñ I wanna smell the leather ñ That covers you now ñ You know exactly what I feel ñ You know how to treat me ñ Lock me up ñ I wanna feel the pain ñ Hit me ñ I like it so much ñ I feel my body crying ñ I feel the torture again ñ I hear my soul screaming ñ I need my soul to be satisfied
Morning seems strange, almost out of place ñ I searched hard for you and your special ways ñ These days, these days ñ I used all your time, learnt a killer's art ñ Took threats and abuse till I'd learnt the part ñ Can you stay for these days? ñ These days, these days ñ Used outward deceptions to get away ñ Broken heart romance to make it pay ñ These days, these days ñ We'll drift through it all, this the modern age ñ Take care of it all now these debts are paid ñ Can you stay for these days?
Lyrics From Snippet ñ  ñ Yo ñ Niggas be flippin' drugs ñ Goverment flippin' us ñ Yes, I love nature but I hit the budd ñ I go hard like I saw tits and butts ñ Rippin' blunts, fillin' 'em up with the prettiest nugs ñ I'm like green kush, ya cigarette

Oppress, enslave, murder and rape ñ Faith is death, atrocity is god's truth ñ Nature empowers, then mankind devours ñ Nature empowers, then mankind devours ñ Peace will never exist
It's a Raymond Chandler Evening ñ At the end of someone's day ñ And I'm standing in my pocket ñ And I'm slowly turning grey ñ I remember what I told you ñ But I can't remember why ñ And the yellow leaves are falling ñ In a spiral from the sky ñ There's a body on the railings ñ That I can't identify ñ And I'd like to reassure you but ñ I'm not that kind of guy ñ It's a Raymond Chandler Evening ñ And the pavements are all wet ñ And I'm lurking in the shadows ñ 'Cause it hasn't happened yet
Laid to rest ñ I have seen no future ñ The demise of myself ñ Lifeless are my actions ñ To be free ñ In a state of isolation ñ Enclosed from creation ñ Blood is all I see ñ The triumph over this test ñ One must not be saved ñ For I have seen no light ñ Fall from hell into the grave ñ Nightfall has come ñ Black has spread ñ I am no more ñ How can one see ñ When ignorance has cloaked his surrounding hope ñ Alone I await darkness overtakes

Apathy - "The End of Me"
Deafness, silence wait for me ñ Like it loud, wide open loud ñ Burn my hearing, jar my brain ñ Won't turn it down for anything ñ Never learn, let it burn ñ Never learn, let it burn ñ Beyond the threshold of pain ñ Can't even think ñ Say, I'm on the brink ñ What you say I'm unaware? ñ What you say I don't care ñ Too loud is an idea ñ I can't comprehend ñ What you say I'm unware? ñ Whay you say I don't care

Running and seeking your face ñ Finding our place lost in your grace ñ Hidden covered encased ñ Destined to win finish the race ñ There is a sound to be heard ñ From the sons of the earth ñ Show his glory and worth ñ Let it ring from the mountains be heard ñ In the valleys and streams ñ Let the high praises ring ñ Hosanna in the highest ñ Hosanna in the highest ñ Hosanna in the highest ñ Hosanna, hosanna ñ Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Everything's going down, eroding to the ground ñ Sincerity running thin ñ What it means to me, it never meant to them ñ So now you take your shots ñ You think you know what I'm about ñ But you don't know me ñ I'll back up every word I say ñ What remains is more than words ñ Everything going down, eroding to the ground ñ Sincerity running thin ñ What it means to me, it never meant to them ñ What remains more than words ñ What remains, more than your words

10,000 years of civilization ñ Culminate in the exploitation ñ Of all men & all women ñ Of the Earth & all things living ñ & all knowledge ñ Is now censored ñ Of our once ñ Wild nature ñ To be replaced ñ With shows like Survivor ñ & all mating patterns ñ On Discovery Channel ñ Herded into apartments ñ & then into their graves ñ Death spare not the tiger  ñ Or the human race
The Jungle Brothers man ñ You see that's basically what jungle brothers are about. Surviving... And helping others to survive
At twilight the day sheds its skin letting our starved hands in ñ By sun-up the night's fully dressed giving our tired hands rest ñ At twilight the day sheds its skin ñ Don't lay down ñ Sheets rise ñ You sleep like the end is night ñ You sleep like the bed's on fire ñ Hands in the night ñ Cut through the thickest hours ñ At twilight the day sheds its skin letting our starved hands in ñ By sun-up the night's fully dressed giving our tired hands rest
Living like they never thought they ever could ñ ...forest turn to soot ñ Burning out the sun ñ Gonna get mine before the end is come ñ Liars practice tricks for ten percent of gross ñ ...the people in their homes ñ Well, I curse this day ñ My horse was caught in the parade ñ Running from your death ñ Last year, you were ñ Bragging about your gold ñ Ways...
Intertwined thoughts with yours ñ Stitched up wounds are open once again ñ Aappreciation of my silence ñ Will be held no more ñ So close to your desires ñ But I will not encourage my blood ñ To be spilled for indignity ñ And I would cry but it would kill all that I know ñ Still utter deceit enters my flesh ñ And I contemplate the end as I grasp for breath ñ Bearing bloody memories while kneeling ñ Down letting my insides pour out ñ And my enraged memories won't let me open ñ These wounds anymore
Talk ñ Talking's hard ñ We're tripping over ñ Each minefield ñ  ñ Walk ñ You can walk so far ñ In your own shoes ñ You don't what anyone feels ñ  ñ Oh my father ñ Oh my brother ñ Love is what ñ Is good ñ  ñ Blame ñ We blame each other ñ Nothing gonna change ever ñ 'Til we forgive ñ  ñ It's a shame, shame ñ It's a shame for our mother ñ The only one to leave this world knowing ñ That in peace, we can live ñ  ñ Oh my father ñ Oh my brother ñ Love is what ñ Is good
They claimed it was the key ñ To everlasting beauty ñ The masses flocked ñ They couldn't keep it in stock ñ After a year ñ The side effects appeared ñ A tingling of the face ñ Became an itch that none could take ñ Now the girls decompose ñ With their pretty skulls exposed
Well I hate to have to tell you this ñ But there were pigeons in the attic room ñ When you left me standing gasping that afternoon ñ And where the floorboards left their splinters ñ As you left me so soon ñ And me, I'm drunk again ñ And when I'm drunk I make no sense ñ But I crack more jokes and that's my self defense ñ You caused me to think ñ And I thought about what I had done without you ñ You drove me to drink ñ And I never had the courtesy to thank you
Freedom fighter.... ñ I'm a freedom fighter.... ñ Yes im freedom fighter.... ñ Thats what i am ñ I'm a freedom fighter.... ñ Thats what i am...
These pages have become a mass grave for thought and reason ñ This hellish maze inside my mind, a vortex for the diseased and the poisoned ñ Now I find myself staring at two empty hands and I'll give everything I have ñ But it's nothing ñ I'll give you everything, but its nothing ñ Progression though depression ñ Passion through deception
Set this place on fire, burn it to the ground ñ 'Cause I don't want to live here anymore ñ Take away these thoughts that empty me ñ Could You take them all away? ñ Am I too blind? I can't see, it's killing me ñ I feed off abuse, nothing's changed ñ It always bleeds like this ñ The holiest of liars, what have I become? ñ I'm holding on to nothing once again ñ Addiction holds the keys to my freedom ñ Could You take it all away? ñ Am I too blind? I can't see ñ It always bleeds like this
At the station the train is leaving at eight ñ Nothing's gonna make me stay hey hey ñ No room for trouble in this old suitcase ñ Nothing's gonna make me stay hey hey ñ And i'd call if there was something to say but hey hey hey ñ Nothing's gonna make me stay hey hey ñ I'd call if there was something to say but hey hey hey ñ Nothing's gonna make me stay hey hey ñ And though it would have been a year in may hey hey hey ñ Nothing's gonna make me stay hey hey
Picked up umbrella ñ Put on my bowler ñ Looked in mirror ñ Ready for the tango ñ I phoned a taxi ñ For me and Maxi ñ She looked fantasti ñ We did the tango ñ Whoaho we danced the tango x2 ñ Dont go, we danced the tango ñ We drank champagne ñ We danced again ñ We had laughter ñ And then after ñ Whoaho we danced the tango x2 ñ Dont go, we danced the tango ñ Face to face we danced ñ The tango ñ Cheek to cheek we danced ñ The tango ñ Dont go, we danced the tango x4
The terms stay within the lines ñ Between the scream ñ The terms stay within the lines ñ Between the scream ñ I'm fallin, I'm fallin into me ñ I'm fallin ñ You must listen ñ Don't feel forever, well I don't feel ever ñ  ñ I'm fallin, I'm fallin into you ñ I'm fallin
Good morning, it's rush hour, my coffee is already gone ñ Smoke in the mirror, somebody's jumping the bridge ñ And I know it's okay, 'cause it's Monday ñ Good morning, it's rush hour, my coffee is already gone ñ Smoke in the mirror, somebody's jumping the bridge ñ And I know it's okay, 'cause it's Monday ñ And I know, I'm late, late again

Here i can't find my place and liberation may not equal change ñ I'm not remembering my name, four years gone and im still waiting ñ Time wasted hesitating ñ All those endless nights we never kissed ñ Can i ever learn to walk away? ñ Hesitatoin makes it easier to stay, broken heart and all ñ These days i've spent lamenting apathy defines my everything ñ We could run so far from what we know

Walking in the winter down rows of empty sidewalks ñ I reached into my pocket, found an old note from you ñ It read "Babydoll, I love you. Can't wait to see you Sunday." ñ I tried to hear you read it, can't remember your voice ñ Was it sweet? ñ Was it sultry? ñ Did I tremble when I heard it? ñ Did you sing softly to me, whisper words in my ear? ñ So I sit and I think of you ñ So I sit and I wonder who you sing songs to now
Trouble in mind, I'm blue ñ But I won't be blue always ñ Got the sun gonna shine ñ In-a my backdoor someday ñ Trouble in mind, it's true ñ I almost lost my mind ñ Life ain't worth livin', baby ñ Sometime I feel like dyin' ñ I'm gonna lay my head ñ On some lonesome railroad track ñ Let a 2:19 train, ah ñ Ease my worried mind

Here's my report on life so far, time is short til the ñ Headaches shaking, sitting in the lobby watching fish ñ Swim in their own shit, he wished he could go two strokes ago ñ So to God up on his throne won't you spare the jokes while ñ You watch all of us choke are you sitting laughing rationing ñ Out mercy on our souls, this can't be how things go, he wished ñ He could go two strokes ago
Patient silence filled the air that day ñ So ominous but known ñ And as usual all those lovers just made their farewells ñ But then they never came back home ñ  ñ Lost salvation - never again ñ Tearing whole you apart ñ It is your lost salvation - ñ You'll never forget this scar inside your heart ñ Raging seas of flames around ñ And now that nothing stayed the same ñ Would you please tell me now why on earth could future shatter ñ For you who're still waiting in vain? ñ  ñ Still to hope they will come back...

Well I will try to be true ñ If I wasn't locked in your gaze ñ Would I be lost, and would I know ñ Spoke with you and saw the next day ñ You were gone, you had to go ñ And I will try to be true ñ If I were to say what you meant to me ñ A painted century, a breakthrough ñ If I walk the path that you set for me ñ Could I eventually stand with you? ñ And I will try to be true ñ Years and years I roamed ñ You showed me the stars ñ If I wasn't locked in your gaze
Dying and trying; it ain't the same thing ñ When it comes down to the end ñ Like the end of a movie ñ It ain't the same thing ñ Don't think about crying inside ñ Don't tell me I'm right - wrong ñ Your tears won't amount to anything ñ My wet shoulder tells a different story ñ Or a little lie; it's always the same

You search me, You know me ñ You see my every move ñ There's nothing I could ever do ñ To hide myself from you ñ You know my thoughts, my fears and hurts ñ My weaknesses and pride ñ You know what I am going through ñ And how I feel inside ñ But even though you know ñ You will always love me ñ Even though You know ñ You'll never let me go ñ I don't deserve Your love ñ But You give it freely ñ You will always love me ñ Even though You know ñ (repeat all) ñ Yes you will always love me ñ Even though you know
Sun slowly fades while moon arises ñ I'm entering a world I recognize ñ Beaming stars rise one by one ñ And dance around the corners of my mind, of my mind ñ Look around see autumn changing ñ The forest seems to bend as I walk by ñ Visions I can't comprehend ñ World around me slowly comes alive ñ My soul cascades in dark cold patterns ñ Wonder if my eyes are telling lies ñ Stars bow down with moons alignment ñ Leaving me to rise above them all, rise above them all

Maybe everything is tragic and temporary ñ Remember Esme at age thirteen? ñ Already blase and broken hearted, so elegant, so considerate ñ If only she were older ñ As a result of my history I'm afraid that I'll let you down ñ If only we were older
Between the searching and the need to work it out ñ I stop believing everything will be alright ñ Broken, we are broken ñ  ñ I'm walking uphill being turned around and round ñ Secret in motion when my feet are on the ground ñ Broken, we are broken ñ  ñ In my mind's eye ñ One little boy anger one little man ñ Funny how time flies

Sometimes I think about our good old high school days ñ You would always kid about my adolescent ways ñ Oh, Mary, Mary, good to see you too ñ Haven't seen too many of the old crew ñ The time just flew, and how are you? ñ Strange we should meet here ñ Seeing off our friends ñ It's hard to draw the line between ñ Beginnings and ends ñ Oh, Mary, Mary, must you go so soon? ñ We must be a sight to see ñ Salon and Saloon ñ I'll look you up soon ñ Maybe sing you a tune

Once I laughed when I heard you saying ñ That I'd be playing solitaire ñ Uneasy in my easy chair ñ It never entered my mind ñ And once you told me I was mistaken ñ That I'd awaken with the sun ñ And ordered orange juice for one ñ It never entered my mind ñ You had what I lack, myself ñ Now I even have to scratch my back myself ñ Once you warned me that if you scorned me ñ I'd say the maiden's prayer again ñ And wish that you were there again ñ To get into my hair again ñ It never entered my mind ñ It never entered my mind
The loveliness of Paris ñ Seems somehow sadly gay ñ The glory that was Rome, is over for another day. ñ I've been terribly lone, and forgotten in Manhattan, I'm going home to my city by the bay. ñ  ñ I left my heart ñ In San Francisco ñ High on a hill, it calls to me. To be little cable cars, I'm halfway to the stars. The morning fog, will chill the air. ñ I don't care ñ My love waits there ñ In San Francisco ñ Above the blue and windy seas ñ when I come home to you, San Francisco ñ your golden sun will shine for me

Computer assisted design ñ See how you get from a thought to an object ñ Computer assisted design ñ It takes an idea and makes 3D stuff ñ Computer assisted design ñ Bam ñ Crunch ñ Bolt ñ Smash ñ Crash ñ Twitch ñ Computer assisted design ñ See how you get from a thought to an object ñ Computer assisted design ñ It takes an idea and makes 3D stuff ñ Computer assisted design
The lyrics for this song have yet to be transcribed
The park we do this ñ Yeah, the park we do this ñ  ñ Candy apple, honey kisses ñ Play the pharaoh, one with riches on the throne ñ Harrow bones, stand alone, cow will moan ñ Finger pop the  with the rastas, y'all imposters ñ We the mobsters eating pasta ñ  so influenced by the music
Gotta get, gotta get, gotta get, gotta get ñ Gotta get, gotta get right there ñ  ñ  ñ Gotta, gotta come together
If you're alone and ñ I'm alone ñ Let's be alone together ñ We can have a drink ñ And shoot the shit ñ And talk about the weather ñ Cause baby I know ñ This world has got you ñ Shaking in your shoes ñ So if you're alone and ñ I'm alone ñ Why don't we be alone together?
A fiery soul's motion ñ Inside a vibration never seen ñ Fragments from our existence ñ Cosmic instruments released ñ I travel mathematical events ñ The mind's space in centre ñ Beams of a star, hides ñ The function a spirit swallows ñ In ecstacy burning ñ The universal door ñ Every spark sinks into the dark ñ My visibility, a nebular eruption ñ From the night sky's zones ñ The cross worlds profound ñ A coronation from flares
Tosonguyn oroygoor toosrood ñ Tosonguyn oroygoor toosrood ñ Tosonguyn oroygoor toosrood ñ Carly, don't be sad ñ Life is crazy, life is mad ñ Don't be afraid ñ Carly, don't be sad ñ That's your destiny, the only chance ñ Take it, take it in your hands ñ Tosonguyn oroygoor toosrood ñ Tosonguyn oroygoor toosrood ñ Tosonguyn oroygoor toosrood ñ Tosonguyn oroygoor toosrood ñ Carly, don't be sad
Lyrics From Snippet: ñ Yeah, wouldn't say that I'm invincible ñ But I would say that I got armor though, hard as stone ñ Crack it, you might wake the ghost ñ Of eight-year-old me tryna face the cold ñ Waitin' for dad or anybody that loved me to ñ Put they arms around me and tell me, "Way to go" ñ Sad, lookin'--
Person 1:Ramirez you can't race, this race is too dangerous ñ Ah, Uh, Ah ñ Person 2:Yeah ramirez you are risking your life ñ Uh, Ah, Ih ñ Ramirez: Man fuck y'all niggas ñ Person 1 & 2: Nooo! ñ Ah, Uh , Wow
I wish I had a dollar ñ For each time I took a chance ñ On all those two-bit Romeos ñ Who count a thin romance ñ Somehow always thinking ñ Of the last time I fell down ñ Knowing that you fall in love ñ Once upon a town
I don't understand ñ I'm the one to stand ñ Through this heavy steam ñ Alone I scream ñ Now it's time to fight ñ Our honor is stained ñ Flowing from the flames ñ My sword stands right ñ The hunt has begun ñ Every step I take ñ Following her trace ñ She will rest in peace ñ I ride through the night ñ I leave the past behind ñ I cry through the night ñ I left my life behind
Are you lookin' at the moon tonight ñ You even brave enough to try ñ To find your strength inside ñ Change your mind, decide ñ Cause I fell from the sky ñ I tried to catch your eye ñ In a velvet sky ñ Did you wish upon a fallin' star ñ Do you know where you are in your life ñ Are you walkin' in between the lines ñ I can tell by the look in your eyes ñ You're hurtin' way down inside ñ Afraid to leave your pain behind ñ Never know what you're gonna find ñ When you look up at the velvet sky ñ You will finally come alive
If not now ñ When ñ If not now ñ When ñ If not now ñ When ñ If not now ñ If not now ñ When ñ If not now ñ When ñ If not now ñ When ñ If not now ñ Not yesterday no no ñ Not tomorrow woe oh ñ Not a minute ahead ñ Not a minute behind ñ Not next time no no ñ No last time woe oh ñ Not a fleeting hour ñ Not a setting sun
I left on a whim ñ Clean up the kitchen ñ Please, remind the kids ñ They need my permission ñ  ñ Picture me ñ Glistening, overseas ñ Nnnh, nnnhhh, nhhh ñ  ñ I missed weekend shore ñ The time is summer ñ My truest amor ñ Left for your shiva ñ  ñ Picture me ñ Glistening, overseas ñ Nnnhhh, nnh, nhh
Are you ready? ñ 2,3,4 go ñ Yeah I'm gonna pee on you, i'm gonna pee on you ñ Yeah, i'm gonna pee on you, i'm gonna pee on you
You thought you had me in your pocket ñ But I never could be bought ñ I avoided traps you set out ñ Too many have been caught ñ Be it love or be it money ñ It's the bait you must resist ñ Be it milk or be it honey ñ This is one boy, you have missed ñ You knew if you could win me over ñ I would always see your side ñ Any argument against you ñ I'd never let it ride ñ I defended with devotion ñ I believed what you had said ñ But you dealt without emotion ñ Something happened in your head
Breathe the air, come to life ñ Put your faith in me ñ Fly every time we touch ñ Follow me beyond here and now ñ Breathe the air, come to life ñ Put your faith in me ñ Fly every time we touch ñ Follow me beyond here and now
You wanna climb up the stairs ñ I wanna push you back down ñ But I let you inside ñ So you can push me around ñ If I leave before you ñ And I walk out alone ñ Keep your hands to yourself ñ When you follow me home ñ  ñ I don't want love ñ I don't want love ñ  ñ We wake up with pounding heads ñ Bruised down below ñ I should have built better walls ñ Or slept in my clothes ñ So if I see you again ñ Desperate and stoned ñ Keep your prison locked up ñ And I will leave my gun at home ñ  ñ I don't want love ñ I don't want love ñ I don't want love
Someday you'll be sorry ñ The way you treated me was wrong ñ I was the one who taught you all you know ñ Your friends have told you to make me sing another song ñ So good luck may be with you ñ And for the future have no fears ñ There won't be another to treat you like a brother ñ Someday you'll be sorry dear
No man can ñ Reduce the world ñ I hear the message ñ But my faith is weak ñ An orphan afraid ñ To tell even himself ñ Sweep the sons ñ Of Adam down ñ Art may improve ñ Our own undoing
Starting to come together ñ Starting to all make sense ñ We began to blossom, so perfect ñ I'm starting to understand ñ  ñ And you have made this cove for us again ñ  ñ If this was any other day, surely just walk away ñ If this was any other day, surely just walk away ñ  ñ Working it out so perfect ñ A picture worth a thousand words ñ Can't believe we took it, so wasted ñ I'm starting to understand ñ  ñ And I gather all myself for you ñ  ñ  ñ I'm starting to understand
This life is an open wound that will not heal ñ I cry out to God with all of my strength ñ Desperately I reach for Him in the night ñ This misery keeps my eyes from closing ñ Keeps my mouth from being able to speak ñ Is this as far as the arm of God extends ñ Has the fire burned itself out ñ There is no profit in this way of thinking ñ I must escape this frame of mind ñ And when I think of all He has done ñ When I consider all that He is ñ I am complete
(Instrumental with vocals)
Old thunderbird all yellow ñ Old thunderbird all yellow ñ Old thunderbird all yellow ñ When the nighttime came ñ You looked the same ñ Still yellow
Nothing to see here ñ Just the son of god ñ Nobody special ñ Just the fucking lord ñ Keep right on walking ñ Why would you stop ñ Whats inside the stable? ñ Just some dumb old baby ñ That's right keep moving ñ The lords born everyday ñ You can come tomorrow ñ He's getting born then too ñ This is what you're saying ñ Youve already seen him born ñ You're not stopping are you ñ So ill just shut up ñ Yes ill just shut up now ñ I said ill just shut up now ñ This is me shutting up now ñ Im shuttting up
Leaving behind ñ Without regrets but pleasant memories ñ What once was ñ We walk towards tomorrow, free ñ Listening, analyzing, communicating ñ Never forgetting ñ That meaningful signs ñ Come from the heart
I don't know ñ Why some people getting excitiness ñ Then over these years is extra to doing ñ Why (tell me why) some people getting excitiness ñ Over the years I'm share love ain't tears
Here you are again ñ It's a lonely life ñ Puttng down a friend ñ But you know you're right ñ She don't want to think its an oversight ñ We don't come to see things overnight ñ I've been thinking about another life ñ You try anything to prove you're right ñ Illuminate it in another light ñ But we don't come to see things overnight ñ When you coming home?
God only knows ñ That sometimes ñ It's hard to even fake a smile ñ It gets so old looking at these ñ City Lights ñ So dark and lonely but I'll be alright ñ I'm praying ñ  ñ My misery ñ Bring it down come and take it from me ñ My misery ñ Love is careless in just who it might see ñ My misery ñ So far away ñ Closer than those ñ Who are surrounding me ñ Something's reaching something unseen ñ Keeps coming over me and ñ Calling my name
Blight! ñ The plow is rusted ñ The plains are broken ñ Hard times, hot rhymes ñ Rock me ñ Rock candy ñ Rock candy shoppe ñ Give me some now ñ Burn it down ñ Boil the ashes ñ Burn, burn, boil it down
Here comes the knife ñ Comes to me closer ñ Faster than life ñ Faster than life ñ Here comes the knife ñ The end comes closer ñ Closer to the light ñ Closer to the light ñ Hail remember within ñ On to everafter ñ Hail remember within ñ On to everafter ñ Leaves close the sight ñ Covers me over ñ Closer to the light ñ Closer to the light ñ Hail remember within ñ On to everafter ñ Hail remember within ñ On to everafter

You feel the mountain shaking ñ Your broken body aching ñ The suffering I give you ñ Is going to help you pull through ñ You'll never feel this way again ñ Just let it go and it will end ñ The thunder shakes your backbone ñ While healing you're not alone ñ These things will make you stronger ñ Depressing you no longer! ñ You'll never feel this way again ñ Just let it go and it will end ñ Never let it bring you down ñ Stay strong til' the bitter end! ñ Take control and never drown ñ Now you can touch the light!
We were down on 10th ñ You told me I looked spent ñ Gave that look you give ñ And rushed me to the river ñ  ñ Del, Del Rio ñ Del, Del Rio ñ  ñ We filled our cups ñ Drank to drinken up ñ Then when we were done ñ We threw ourselves in the river ñ  ñ Del, Del Rio ñ Del, Del Rio ñ  ñ Getting some strange looks back from the shore ñ And you, you pinched my arm ñ Said, "Look who's lucky now" ñ And you, you saved my life ñ Too many times to count ñ  ñ Del, Del Rio ñ Del, Del Rio
I had to go away ñ (follow behind) ñ With nothing left to say ñ (follow behind) ñ Our lies ñ Our lies ñ Cremona ñ Cremona ñ I follow behind ñ I followwwwww

Johnson ñ The monsters in your heart are feasting off your stomach now ñ You'd tell someone about the matter but you don't know how ñ You broke your wings ñ You broke your wings trying to be ñ You broke your wings ñ You broke your wings flying to me ñ The machination of your secret has all failed you now ñ Into some spiral to the point where we can't get you out ñ You broke your wings ñ You broke your wings trying to be ñ You broke your wings ñ You broke your wings trying to be a little too free
There's no doubt or fire ñ Misses peace of mind ñ And when good will has hunted you down ñ Who knows what dreams may come ñ Awakenings may come ñ  ñ There's no hope for Aladdin ñ A king has caught his last fish ñ My captain, oh my captain ñ Goodnight Vietnam, goodnight ñ Goodnight Vietnam, goodnight
The records you stole years ago ñ Covered in scratches ñ Listened to once ñ You took better care of them ñ Than I would of you ñ Trading heartbreak for sentiment ñ Like paying the rent with yr tears
Merrily they danced on fire ñ I don't know why I hated fire ñ Something old it must have been ñ The way I was they must have seen ñ In fear of fire, fire
Underwater gold ñ  ñ Little louder... ñ A little little louder now ñ A little little louder now... ñ Oh ñ  ñ (It's still--it's still not that loud, but it's very fun...)
Take off the old ñ Put on the new ñ Refill my mind memorize ñ Cut off the thought before it goes to action ñ Cut off the thought as soon as it starts ñ Take off this weight I don't have to wear ñ But I like it, Like it too much ñ Gotta cut off the thought before it goes to action ñ Cut off the thought as soon as it starts

Caught in a photograph ñ The final breath before a winter's coming ñ Lost in a photograph ñ The innocence of youth, a memory ñ No more fooling 'round ñ Assuming that life is forever ñ And your dreams will come true in the end ñ Caught in a photograph ñ With no resemblance to my present living ñ Lost in a photograph ñ There's nothing left as I fade away

Laugh a lot ñ It'll be so sad so soon ñ Laugh a lot ñ You're getting older ñ Humorless years ñ Laugh a lot your getting so old ñ Your years are humorless and years are merciless ñ Snd don't even get mad ñ And don't even get mad ñ You hate to make a place for yourself ñ Oh love light switches don't come with it ñ It's so funny ñ So lie there ñ And die there ñ And laugh a lot... ñ We die ñ We die ñ Laugh when your parents expire ñ I laughed when my parents expired
You've stepped too far outta line ñ You've ripped us off for the last time ñ Now you've gone and had your fun ñ We're gonna kill you for what you've done ñ Said and Done, Said and Done ñ Now beware of what you do ñ Cause we're always watching you ñ If you ever lose our trust ñ You'd better fucking look out for us
One other year has left my life ñ One year bygone so soon ñ These were the days I sacrificed ñ These days were lived for you ñ Some came with winter in white ñ Some days were blown away ñ Some came with sultry summer nights ñ Some with October rain ñ Oh, how I long for utter silence ñ But who am I to know ñ When rain will turn to snow? ñ If life brings another day
There's nothing left around you ñ You fall into the sand ñ No shining light to guide you ñ There's nowhere else to stand ñ If you knew how I felt ñ  ñ I heard someone will find you ñ Hidden beneath the dunes ñ Or I could just stay hiding ñ Discover something new ñ You could be someone else
Give it a one! Give it a two! Give it a three! ñ (the rest of this song is an instrumental)
I saw my face in the mirror ñ And now I understand ñ Johathon Jonathon Jonathon.... ñ I'm just a man ñ There was no love to shelter me ñ Love
Regress; in spells of unconsciousness ñ Slave to the seeds you've sown ñ Lost in the leaves ñ So we'll depart ñ Goodbye to your stubborn heart ñ Now you're alone ñ Find relief that the end comes swiftly for you
A ti ñ Sueno desnudo ñ Abierta tras la ventana ñ A ti ñ Mi flor primera ñ De estio en la madrugada ñ A ti ñ Mi memorable cuerpo ñ De arena y campanas ñ A ti ñ Mi adolescencia ñ Que vuelves en la distancia ñ Recordandote... ñ Yesterday ñ Love was such an easy game to play...

Wanna dream alone till I see my own functions ñ Wanna dream alone till I burst like lightning ñ Escape from it and turning to the human trash we dreamed ñ Floating on the lonely junkyard (x2) ñ Feel, You can feel, You can heal... ñ ... The remains
Ay yo, I'm back on this bitch, let's go ñ Back ñ Put your motherfucking, yo-fucking ñ Your motherfucking back 
My fear's like a wall, I don't need no walls at all ñ Like the shining sun, shining sun is so much fun ñ Fear's like a wave, ride it out, just let it cave ñ Like the shining sun, shining sun is so much fun ñ My fear's like a wall, I don't need no walls at all ñ Like the shining sun, shining sun is so much fun ñ Fear's like a wave, ride it out, just let it cave ñ Like the shining sun, shining sun is so much fun
They try to tell us ñ We're too young ñ Too young to really be in love ñ They said that loves a word ñ A word will only hurt ñ But can't begin to know the meaning of ñ Any if we're not too young ñ To know this love will last the years may go ñ And then someday they may recall ñ We were not too young at all ñ And then someday they may recall ñ We were not too young at all
God gave you life ñ So get out of mine ñ And take your sorry ass ñ Back to florida ñ You're not welcome here ñ Ain't it perfectly clear ñ Take your sorry ass ñ Back to florida ñ Chorus: ñ You bring us down ñ Don't come around ñ You bring us down ñ You bring us down ñ Repeat chorus ñ You live a charmed life ñ But nothing seems right to you ñ Roses and wine ñ Thorns and vinegar ñ Your only delight ñ Is other's demise ñ So take your sorry ass ñ Back to florida ñ Repeat chorus x6
The weather vane was pointing eastward ñ When we heard the sound ñ Of rolling thunder underneath ñ The shed above the ground ñ The gentle breezes long ago ñ Had given way to rain ñ When, moving in between the clouds ñ We saw a shaking plane ñ As we looked up and stood upon ñ The field that we had plowed ñ It seemed to stop and strangulate ñ Upon the darkest cloud ñ It made a graceful arching dive ñ Into a field of grass ñ Yesterday we found a purse ñ Today we found some glass
Know me like I do ñ I know I'm nothing without You ñ I need Your spirit in my heart ñ Show me ways I'll never depart ñ Now all I need to say is how much I need You ñ You're all I long to see ñ My friend who gave His life for me ñ Youre All I Long to be ñ Jesus, the Hero inside of me is You ñ Jesus, You're my Hero ñ Jesus, You're my Hero ñ Jesus, Jesus, Jesus the hero in me

When we all have gone to the silence of eternity ñ To first be forgotten and lost in the records of the earth ñ Could I still miss you then ñ In the time and space after life ñ When no one is searching anymore ñ And where we are nowhere to be found? ñ We didn't spend our life together ñ And I will miss you forever ñ The choice was mine ñ To long for a time that will never come ñ Though we leave the world apart ñ I still went peacefully, quietly ñ With you still firmly ñ In my heart ñ And I will wait forever ñ I will wait
Even your going ñ Let it find you ñ Even in hiding ñ Find it knows you ñ  ñ Rocking you to sleep ñ From the Otherside ñ  ñ Tethered by timing ñ Let it undo ñ Aimless and ripped ñ From the root ñ Binds you ñ  ñ Rocking you to sleep ñ From the Otherside

Found in human likeness ñ And He reduced to the standards of the earth ñ In famine He dealt with sufferings ñ And in His deeds revealed His love and faith ñ And all selflessness ñ It's with His blood we bathe ñ To focus on the name of the Lord Jesus ñ The Son of God ñ And in fullness God Himself ñ He came to our filth ñ And died to our sins ñ Rising to consecrate glory ñ He rose us with Him from the abyss ñ Breaking our blackened deeds and intent ñ Rising within Him and now we live
I have fought the good fight ñ I have finished the race ñ I have kept the faith ñ I have kept the faith ñ And now there is in store for me ñ The crown of righteousness ñ Which the Lord the righteous judge ñ Will award to me on that day ñ And not only to me but also to all ñ Who have longed for His appearing ñ --- ñ .
I am a loyal dog ñ My name is sorrow ñ A name they gave me ñ When I took their joy away ñ With my first breath ñ I am a loyal dog ñ I'll stay by your side forever ñ And when you finally give up ñ I'll eat what's left of you ñ I am a loyal dog

There is a time in life it seems ñ For believing in dreams, for me it's gone ñ And though I realize today ñ Dreams are empty anyway, I still feel wronged ñ Chorus ñ I felt cheated when you went away ñ But not as defeated as I felt the day ñ You came back and we found so little to say ñ There is a time in life I know ñ When we all must outgrow young ideals ñ And the wisdom that we gain ñ Is paid for with the pain I now feel ñ Chorus ñ There is a time in life it seems ñ For believing in dreams for me it's gone
Big business and government should not mix ñ Go back running Harkin into the ground ñ And take that Haliburton piece of shit with you

The boatman is waiting to sail me away ñ These aching hands have worked me through another day ñ But i hear a tremble in our northern sky ñ And like the wind that shakes the valley i will fly ñ Ferry me over ferry me on ñ Ferry me over ferry me on
If ask me to cast you lay ñ I would say dont never ask me againe ñ Then i imagine you walk away ñ Thats what i want , so thats okay ñ Promside dont have know what say ñ .. ñ Can help me to face the morning ñ . ñ Ohh life out of time ñ But i want to share you with mine ñ Ohh life out of time ñ Strange things that hapening inside ñ Its can a take the little time ñ .. ñ I dont care about things you wear ñ ..
Left in the dark with nothing to hold ñ Backing away from a following march ñ Out of my grasp ñ Out of control ñ I'm watching you fade ñ Everythings distorted ñ Out of my head ñ Out of context ñ Nothing is peachy, nothing is perfect ñ Different eyes are staring back ñ Nothing is peachy nothing is perfect ñ Different eyes are staring back ñ Nothing is peachy nothing is perfect
When the owl breaks the light beam in ñ A nights dream ride. am i seeing in slow ñ Am i driving too fast for the sound to ñ Finally break past time spent following ñ Straight lines to death ñ Behind my eyes in a parallel sky she ñ Belongs in the shapes in the clouds try ñ To take me to the grounded ones ñ Skyward there's a fog that casts a ñ Planetary haze to hide the white lined ñ Aggression in our eyes ñ In a season of collapsed lungs, there's ñ A dark holiday and we are following ñ Straight lines to death
Bodies clamped firmly in position ñ Ripped open ñ Animal fission ñ Taken beyond the pain barrier and back again ñ Death is the only release ñ Liberation please
If it ends where it all begins ñ Then there's nothing out of time ñ One machine turning everything ñ Till the emptiness unwinds ñ Moving parts falling into place ñ Will it ever be that way?
One other year has left my life ñ One year bygone so soon ñ These were the days I sacrificed ñ These days were lived for you ñ Some came with winter in white ñ Some days were blown away ñ Some came with sultry summer nights ñ Some with October rain ñ Oh, how I long for utter silence ñ But who am I to know ñ When rain will turn to snow? ñ If life brings another day
Breakin' the ice with love ñ We're melting' away stone cold hearts ñ From a winter's day ñ Breakin' the ice with love ñ Releasing the binds that's held man ñ From the start of time ñ It's so easy to do ñ When God's love is with you ñ And is living in ñ And you'll come to find ñ It's just a matter of time ñ When love begins breakin' the ice ñ Sure as a flower needs to have rain ñ Man's need for love is just the same; ñ Sure as the sunrise starts each new day ñ With heaven's love you'll find the way
Open up the gates ñ I'm hoping it's not too late ñ I'm here, I'm here ñ Open up the gates ñ Does good come to those who wait? ñ I'm here, I'm still here ñ Open up the gates ñ I'm hoping it's not too late ñ I'm here, I'm here ñ Atlantis and Avalon ñ Shining behind the dawn ñ I'm still here ñ What has become of me and you? ñ I was so sure we'd make it through ñ I know you saw the waymark too ñ And it's still there, just out of view
On my way home ñ I look at stars

Moxy from the Roxy might turn some heads tonight ñ Flashlight dream, peaches and cream delight ñ Fab up job she's got bubble gum on her knees ñ Roxy Roller ñ Down between the seats sometimes she'll toss you her key ñ So Roxy join the syndicate knowing it wasn't fair ñ Roxy Roller ñ Daddy the commissioner took far more than his share ñ Roxy Roller
When we ate stars, rode the Kraken ñ And all those things that didn't happen ñ Like the gold shoe in the hallway ñ I dreamt I found warm yesterday morning ñ Here's where I sat with your mother ñ Making faces at the faces ñ Here's where I sat with your mother ñ Making places out of places
No surprises please ñ No surprises please ñ No surprises please ñ I like it how it is ñ I like it how it is ñ I hope it stays a while ñ No surprises please ñ No surprises please ñ No surprises please ñ No surprises please ñ I like it how it is ñ I like it how it is ñ I hope it stays a while ñ No surprises please ñ No surprises please ñ No surprises please ñ No surprises please ñ I like it how it is ñ I like it how it is

Burnt ñ Tortured ñ Drowned ñ Shot ñ Everything turns to shit ñ Slag ñ Whore ñ Cunt ñ Slut ñ Everything turns to shit
Someone is waiting ñ To swallow all the halos out of you ñ As your face blows ñ Through my windows ñ Sending pieces flying all around the room ñ And I love you ñ And I want to ñ Shoot all the superheroes from your skies ñ Watch them bleeding ñ From your ceiling ñ As their empty anger falls out from their eyes ñ All alone...

You come to my house and you bring me down ñ Teen dusthead forever ñ One hit, that's all and you bring me down ñ You'll never live to see tomorrow ñ Circle round the stars on the ground ñ Teen dusthead forever ñ Pray to the one that knows who you are ñ You'll never live to see tomorrow
If the big girls don't mind ñ To clap or just snap my fingers ñ I'm trying to decide ñ The world keeps pushing ñ Got a flow all it's own ñ Riding the tide of last night ñ Never alone ñ The falling notes are land slides ñ Picture perfect, love is no where ñ I was silent ñ You were breathless ñ Browsing the walls ñ Like a solo in shreds ñ A flight in a tattered landscape ñ I'll sing you instead ñ I'm looking for motion ñ 'Cause honey I move ñ The aire of a thunder condition ñ I got nothing to prove

Now she's walking through the clouds ñ With a circus mind ñ That's running wild ñ Butterflies and zebras ñ And moonbeams and fairytales ñ All she ever thinks about is riding with the wind ñ When I'm sad she comes to me ñ With a thousand smiles ñ She gives to me free ñ It's alright, it's alright she says ñ Take anything you want from me ñ Anything ñ Fly little wing
I am looking at a beautiful window ñ That window is your eyes ñ And the only time I saw rainfall ñ Was the day your mother died ñ And I am looking at a beautiful rainbow ñ The rainbow is your smile ñ Oh, the only time I heard laughter ñ Was the day I took you as my bride ñ I am looking at a beautiful window ñ The window is your eyes ñ Oh, the only time I saw rainfall ñ Was the day your mother died ñ And I am walking with my Savior ñ My Savior walks with me ñ Oh, He will guide me up to heaven ñ Where you & I shall meet

You can go your own way ñ You can go your own way ñ It doesn't matter what the others say ñ 'Cos you can go your own way ñ You can go your own way ñ You've got a ring on your finger ñ A chain around your heart and your soul ñ Searching for an answer ñ Looking for your own control ñ Walk away from the leader ñ Walk away form the books ñ Walk away from the TV ñ Take a long hard look ñ And you can go your own way
The chaos keeps on raging, still hungry for a thrill - ñ Whatever script we're staging: ñ Holy book's kept close to the gun - now fire at will ñ The cast is ever changing to reinvent its skill - ñ No soppy happy ending: ñ In the name of some God - just fire at will ñ Rest your weary head my son, all your trouble's just begun... it's still ñ A long way home

Baby, I really love you ñ Baby, you're so willing ñ I know I'm not really ñ But the half of you ñ But the older I get ñ The older you get ñ Baby, I'll always love you ñ Baby, even through death ñ I know it sounds funny being absolute ñ But I'm safe in your bed ñ The closer I get
Dear Lord, give me strength to carry on ñ Dear Lord, give me strength to carry on ñ My home may be out on the highway ñ Lord, I've done so much wrong ñ But please, give me strength to carry on ñ Dear Lord, give me strength to carry on ñ Dear Lord, give me strength to carry on ñ My home may be out on the highway ñ Lord, I've done so much wrong ñ But please, give me strength to carry on
Thank God for dracula ñ He sucked the shit outta me ñ Now I can leave my work for nights ñ And leave my day for sleeping ñ Young for eternity ñ Young for eternity ñ Thank God for dracula ñ He sucked the shit outta me ñ Now I can leave my work for nights ñ And leave my day for sleeping ñ Young for eternity ñ Young for eternity ñ Young for eternity ñ Young for eternity ñ Young for eternity ñ Young for eternity
A handful of tickets already paid for ñ A heart, full and jaded, taken for too many rides ñ I'm still looking for somewhere to spend these dreams ñ On the midway between my heart and my mind ñ I hear echoes in these rusty landscapes ñ The sounds of the sunlight bounce off these cold winter walls ñ Deep inside, I move without memory ñ From shadow to shadow in this dark carnival
When I awoke ñ I lay tied to a foreign bed ñ Inside a house ñ Sown out of human flesh ñ A palace of skin graft architecture ñ Oh desolation! ñ I can't stand to fuck these walls ñ Desolation! ñ I can't stand to suck these halls ñ But how do I sleep when the skin ñ I stroke underneath ñ The sheets is mannequin plastique? ñ And I wonder where the girl ñ Who slept beside me has gone ñ When the faces in the photos ñ Stare with glass eyed mystique? ñ Tick, tick, tick, tock ñ I watch the clock for tenderness
Can't get a hold of the leads that I need ñ There is no end to the streets, I'm on my knees ñ And I wish some day things will get better ñ I've been trapped in this black hole for too long ñ Can't understand a word of what you say ñ I've never bother to listen anyway ñ And I know some day things will get better ñ I've been trapped in this black hole for too long ñ Trapped in I've been trapped in I'm furious over the state I'm in
Wait with expectation ñ Wait with anticipation ñ Wait, I will worship you Lord ñ While I wait
"He came on television and said that he had seen God ñ So I stopped channel surfing immediately ñ He said he had seen God, and God told him to raise 8 million dollars ñ God was broke!"
No sound ñ With the weather coming ñ Those little paintings that you did last night ñ On the other side ñ Right above your heart ñ It's so big you got to let it out ñ Somehow ñ Somehow  ñ Do you give up ñ With the water rising ñ You got codes for silence so i shut my mouth ñ I'm on the other side ñ Right above your heart ñ It's so loud you got to let it out ñ Somehow ñ Somehow  ñ  ñ You got codes for silence so i shut my mouth ñ You got codes for silence so i shut my mouth ñ Somehow.....
Terror, torture, agony ñ Endless flood of suffering ñ Christs may come ñ Christs may go ñ Tyrants live forever ñ The art of the age ñ Betrays the soul ñ Destruction as natural as ñ Terror, torture, agony ñ Endless flood of suffering
Heaven ñ I'm in heaven ñ When I close my eyes ñ I'm in heaven ñ The conversation's dead ñ There's someone in my head ñ In and out of time ñ In and out of time ñ Heaven ñ I'm in heaven ñ When I close my mind ñ I'm in heaven ñ Everything is mad ñ The best I've ever had ñ In and out of time ñ In and out of time ñ Heaven ñ I'm in heaven ñ When I close my eyes ñ I'm in heaven ñ Heaven ñ I'm in heaven ñ When I close my mind ñ I'm in heaven
The Green River murderer ñ He's still out there ñ The authorities can't' find him ñ For the prostitutes slain by him ñ Forty-eight and counting ñ Dead prostitutes keep mounting ñ The Green River murderer ñ He's still out there ñ The authorities can't find him ñ A trail of bodies behind him ñ Forty-eight and counting ñ The body count keeps mounting ñ The Green River murderer ñ He's still out there ñ The authorities can't find him ñ For the prostitutes slain by him
Goin' down South, I'm going down South ñ The chilly wind don't blow ñ I'm going with you, babe, I'm going with you babe ñ I'm going with you, babe, I'm going with you babe ñ I don't care where you go
I know a place ñ Where the poets ñ Have no words to sell ñ Now is it heaven ñ Or is it hell ñ  ñ I know a place ñ Where words can't ñ Conjure up a spell ñ Now is it heaven ñ Or is it hell ñ  ñ There are no goldfish ñ Swimming around anyone's head ñ Just the greyish color between right and wrong instead ñ And all the heathen poets are home ñ In bed by eleven ñ  ñ Now is that hell
This place is oh so cold ñ Grasping young and old ñ Come in lock the door ñ The sun is dead, oh Lord ñ Like a thief at night ñ She came in stole the light ñ A winter full of lies ñ Lasting thousaind lives ñ Breathing ice and stone ñ Always so alone ñ I know I won't grow old ñ This place is oh so cold ñ I die in shameless snow ñ Can't feel arm or toe ñ Without reach I am ñ Sunken undergound ñ I drown in water black ñ You said I'll do just that ñ I welcome rain in May ñ It's winter every day
Found some letters you wrote me this morning they told of a love we once knew ñ Now they're gone I'd burned them to ashes ñ Don't want nothing to remind me of you ñ Burning bridges behind me it's too late to turn back now ñ Burning bridges behind me all I want is to forget you somehow ñ Sold the house we once planned together said goodbye to friends we knew ñ Then I moved to a faraway city trying hard to forget about you ñ Burning bridges behind me...
Sample : (ouh, maybe you're right) ñ When the party's over ñ You got no way to go...
It's just another selfish game ñ But i won't participate in this way of conquest ñ Right of passage ñ Strive for stature, exploit the passive ñ Point rank system ñ Joint rape project ñ Count me out, i'm not submitting ñ Your score proves nothing to me ñ Masculinity...

Lyrics Are Unknown
I got swept up in the ocean ñ Undercurrent held my feet ñ Ain't no air for me to breath down here ñ Only salt and the fear from the deep ñ And now I've only got two options ñ Grow some gills or fight the waves ñ I don't want no one to save me from myself ñ I know that it's my storm to tame ñ  ñ Til the surface comes in reach ñ Til the dark don't feel too much like home ñ Til the sand run through my fingers ñ Til my heart and mind feel like my own ñ Til the sky don't seem so far, far away ñ Just keep swimming baby

The black and green scarecrow as everyone knows ñ Stood with a bird on his hat and straw everywhere ñ He didn't care ñ  ñ He stood in a field where barley grows ñ  ñ His head did no thinking ñ His arms didn't move except when the wind cut up rough ñ And mice ran around on the ground ñ  ñ He stood in a field where barley grows ñ  ñ The black and green scarecrow is sadder than me ñ But now he's resigned to his fate ñ 'Cause life's not unkind - he doesn't mind ñ  ñ He stood in a field where barley grows
The half-moon is aching, bitter and sad ñ We are wet. we are stripped to the bone ñ It's out of our hands, the dream we're bound to dream ñ We are wet, always alone ñ How many ways can you say goodbye ñ That was nothing ñ Just a little something ñ How many days were in dreaming ñ In many ways just a lie ñ In better days I'd be dreaming ñ As my life passed me by ñ Now pardon me for trying ñ Trying to tear apart ñ And pardon me for lying ñ It's just easy, so easy, to start
And stashed under our seats are the maps not worth the reach with worship squares we keep getting told about...and can't seem to be found. Maybe that's why so many would rather bow out... so there's a connect, as if we're on the same roads to share the same waste and build a way to ungraves. Close our aisles, less with give and get what we have. To erase. To erupt. Let go of our aims, let go of our best, let go of the wheel and let in the crash

"The darkest clouds are forming ñ Remove my mask of serenity from my tortured face ñ We are as one desire ñ Beneath the infinity of the majestic sky ñ Arise my darkest entity ñ From the domain which I dwell ñ Our time has come ñ This is our kingdom ñ We are the essence of warm winters."
O' consort and mother death ñ Fires speed the sacrifice ñ Waters steal the breath ñ Bloated on human flesh ñ Trampled by their five ñ Claws drip the poison ñ Guardians from the primeval ñ Mortals make us thrive ñ Graveless totems arise ñ Vultures circle vermin ñ Avatar to demons ñ Hound of infection ñ Raptor's possession ñ O' Demon Liege ñ Let our demise serve thee ñ Forever in this blackened sea

Why have ourselves abandoned us ñ Why they no more belong to us ñ Cries in the sky pray to believe ñ My heart and soul will never forgive ñ We are all being used ñ Our lives have been abused ñ Still no one resists ñ I guess ñ There's nothing to lose ñ I am no longer confused ñ You're killing my dreams ñ My heart cries out for the touch I will never have ñ Before my eyes you've burnt everything I loved ñ I'm on the edge and you're forcing me not to fall ñ You'll never see me crawl
Forever haunted by failure ñ I, the mirror won't let them be ñ Contribution to their abuse, my only use ñ A once trusted faith, inverted ñ Defiled, beaten, molested ñ A deep fear to whisper in your ear ñ It will follow you in your sleep ñ You will feel it inside your dreams ñ Transformed underworld, tranquil without light ñ Blessed are the sins of the night (which father do you feel?) ñ A dark red shadow of hate remains ñ (Any arrogance begins to fade, for trauma will always linger, another weakling has been made)
All the summer days ñ Where we used to play ñ Walking hand in hand ñ Castles in the sand ñ  ñ So you said "Goodnight" ñ But you meant "Goodbye" ñ Now our love has died ñ This is why I cry, cry ñ  ñ From the madding crowd ñ Pointing up at clouds ñ Summer turned to fall ñ Pictures on the wall ñ  ñ So you said "Goodnight" ñ But you meant "Goodbye" ñ Now our love has died ñ This is why I cry, cry ñ So you said "Goodnight" ñ But you meant "Goodbye" ñ Now our love has died ñ This is why I cry, cry
I'll take your hearts out to the park ñ And out of the starting gates ñ Down to a place you can relate ñ I'm gonna take you home ñ I'll take your thoughts out for a walk ñ And out of your head ñ And into your hands again ñ Down to your feet ñ So you can walk back home ñ So you can walk back home again ñ So you can walk back home ñ So I'll take your head out to sleep ñ What do you think that should give to me ñ You give me the place ñ Yeah you give me the space ñ So I can feel whole again ñ Yeah you give me the space
Time's two appetites ñ Stanch your heart ñ Engines in the sky ñ Loft day-trippers home ñ Time's two appetites ñ Stanch your heart ñ Engines in the sky ñ Tap the moonlight ñ Sitting by the kindly fire you look down, and realise ... ñ Time's two appetites ñ Stanch your heart ñ Engines in the sky ñ Tap the moon ñ Crouching at the only light for miles, you abide ñ Sitting by the kindly flame that inches ...
Moon river, wider than a mile ñ I'm crossing you in style some day ñ Oh, dream maker, you, heart breaker ñ Wherever you're going I'm going your way ñ Two drifters off to see the world ñ There's such a lot in the world to see ñ We're after the same rainbows end ñ Waiting round the bend, my Huckleberry friend ñ Moon river and me
I was born and then I rose ñ It came to me and then I froze ñ I lost my voice I couldn't see ñ I felt the sweat pour out of me ñ The limelight dimmed and turn me in ñ All my deeds turned to sin ñ The flesh upon my skin began to crawl
If you want something, then you got something, if you want something right now you're gonna get it ñ We can have just what we want ñ It's all there for you
The time has come ñ Arise from death ñ Victory is close at hand ñ Take up the sword and follow me ñ Out of nothing into a new creation ñ A thousand decades of despair will pass away in an instant ñ And You and I will be there ñ With hands raised in victory ñ Fall on your knees ñ The time has come
I can feel it ñ I can feel it ñ I can feel it ñ I can feel it ñ I can feel it ñ I can feel it ñ I can feel it ñ I can feel it ñ I can feel it ñ I can feel it ñ I can feel it
Terminal bedbugs ñ Lungs that wheeze ñ Bicycle female ñ In a busy breeze ñ Scoot down with me, my days will shine ñ And sparklingly chime ñ Sorry for what I said ñ Let go of my head ñ These angels adore you ñ Sorry for what I said ñ Let go of my head ñ The angels adore you

Take me in your arms ñ Before you take your love away ñ Take me in your arms ñ Before we part ñ Let me thrill again ñ To your cares of yesterday ñ Let me fill again ñ My hungry heart ñ One hour of gladness ñ That we knew in the past ñ One moments madness ñ Although it be the last, hold me fast ñ Blind me with your charms ñ With all the stardust in the sky ñ Take me in your arms ñ And then goodbye
Heaven ñ Hard to reach you ñ With the ground beneath ñ Giving into ñ Somewhere ñ Under deep blue ñ Over land and sea ñ We never knew ñ A room with a view ñ Oh, you and I ñ Between the earth and the sky ñ Oh, you and I ñ Between the earth and the sky ñ Heaven ñ Underneath you ñ Drawn into a vacuum ñ Limbo is a strange place ñ In the middle but ñ Never halfway ñ Somewhere under deep blue ñ Over land and sea ñ I know I will be with ñ I will be with you ñ Repeat chorus
Bell on door clanks, come on in ñ Floyd observes my hairy chin ñ Sit down chair, don't be afraid ñ Steamed hot towel on my face ñ  ñ I'm ashamed ñ I'm ashamed ñ I'm ashamed ñ  ñ Barney ties me to the chair ñ I can't see, I'm really scared ñ Floyd breathes hard, I hear a zip ñ Pee-pee pressed against my lips ñ  ñ I'm ashamed ñ I'm ashamed ñ I'm ashamed ñ  ñ I sense others in the room ñ Opie, Aunt Bee, I presume ñ They take turns and cut me up ñ I die smothered in Andy's clutch ñ  ñ I'm ashamed ñ I'm ashamed ñ I'm ashamed
Crazy, I'm crazy for feeling so lonely ñ I'm crazy, crazy for feeling so blue ñ  ñ I knew you'd love me as long as you wanted ñ And then some day you'd leave me for somebody new ñ  ñ Worry, why do I let myself worry? ñ Wondering what in the world did I do? ñ  ñ Crazy, for thinking that my love could hold you ñ I'm crazy for crying and crazy for trying ñ And I'm crazy for loving you ñ Crazy, for thinking that my love could hold you ñ I'm crazy for crying and crazy for trying ñ And I'm crazy for loving you
Oh the line goes on and on ñ Forty years ñ And far beyond ñ Oh the line that working line ñ Stretches from ñ Where the world began ñ Cause we were on the line ñ Yes we were on the line ñ And now we stand together ñ On the line ñ We stand on the line ñ So you'd better not cross that line ñ Cause we will not be broken ñ When we stand on the line
Driving past the stadium ñ Humming 'Elegy for Tim' ñ I saw ten dozen caps and gowns ñ Peasants disguised in crowns, I felt like a king ñ When I saw an end as a start ñ Or his death as just a bit part ñ A quick hello I might forget, I can say hello ñ To other people and other people's pets, other people's pets ñ  ñ Merideth at dawn would sit and let me talk away, talk away ñ Merideth at dawn, I'll pet her as I talk away, talk away
Outside the rain begins ñ And it may never end ñ So cry no more ñ On the shore a dream ñ Will take us out to sea ñ Forever more forever more
Lyrics from Snippet ñ  my city, it's apparent ñ Doing shit I couldn't even imagine ñ  where I'm from,  I'm cashin' ñ Every different state, a different bad bitch ñ Everywhere I go, I keep it savage

It could be in Moscow ñ It could be in France ñ It could be somewhere ñ When I'm lost in a dance ñ I could win a horse ñ I could win a car ñ I would drive it to you ñ Cause it isn't so far ñ I'm missing you ñ I could be somewhere ñ Lost in the rain ñ I could have umbrellas ñ But it is all the same ñ Stagger on buildings and I hear you call ñ I hold myself tight ñ Then I would not fall ñ I'm missing you
These words are like paperships ñ On the river of your attention ñ Sent to reach your ocean ñ And sink into its depths ñ Its water may help to unfold them ñ And its salt may wash their letters ñ Into the very meaning ñ Of who can see ñ The scene discribed right now ñ These words are like paperships ñ On the river of your attention ñ Sent to reach your ocean ñ And sink into its depths
Don't get me wrong ñ I'm still young and I'm not hating but ñ It's not as easy as it seems (whoa oh) ñ 'Cause I'm not out here looking for a hit and run ñ I want someone who can love me for me ñ I'll trade a million bucks ñ For someone's love who don't come with a price ñ I'll trade in all my cars ñ For someone who will love me for life ñ They can take away my platinum plaques ñ That fame and fortune won't mean a thing ñ I'll trade a lifetime just to find someone ñ Who will love me just for me
Sleeping at funerals, puking at parades ñ You need the bullet and the gun
See the pyramids along the Nile ñ Watch the sunrise on a tropic isle ñ Just remember, darling all the while ñ You belong to me ñ See the market place in old Algiers ñ Send me photographs and souvenirs ñ Just remember when a dream appears ñ You belong to me ñ I'll be so lonesome without you ñ Maybe you'll be lonesome too ñ And blue ñ Fly the ocean in a silver plane ñ See the jungle when it's wet with rain ñ Just remember 'til you're home again ñ You belong to me
And I'll build me a robot ñ And we'll look just the same ñ And I'll teach him the handshake ñ And I'll teach him the game ñ And he won't feel empty ñ And I won't feel ashamed ñ And I'll find a way back home ñ And it's one for the money ñ And it's two for the show ñ And it's three to get ready ñ But there's no place to go ñ Cause I'm on the move now ñ But this world moves to slow ñ I need a way back home ñ I need a way back home
You are the infinite ñ You are the infinite (x7) ñ Show us the way.... (unintelligible)
The greatest favorites ñ Willie and Max McGee ñ A brewer killer and a touchdown against the Chiefs ñ It's not my memory; ñ It's everyone I could not be ñ I'm living vicariously on better authority ñ So isn't it absurd beginning the world on strictly television ñ I name the losses I lose the names ñ I talk in circles ñ The world is round the world is coming around the world is round ñ I talk in circles
Lyrics from Snippet ñ But I'm not to be fucked with ñ Hundred Bands, Hundred Bands turn into a million ñ I don't wanna chill, don't know what that look like ñ Got it lock, don't know....
I close your eyes with my mouth ñ Now you don't see anything ñ But you feel my breath all over ñ I can feel you too ñ Although I don't really know you ñ I don't really care ñ Cry with me, make my day ñ Tomorrow all will be gone ñ All the sweetness and all the fun ñ No, I don't wanna know... ñ Although I don't really know you ñ I don't really care ñ Now that you're gone I don't know ñ How to really feel inside ñ Baring the hope to see you again ñ I guess I never will ñ Now that I do really know you ñ Yes, I really care!
We could make believe I love you ñ Only make believe that you love me ñ Others find peace of mind in pretending ñ Couldn't you? couldn't i? couldn't we? ñ Make believe our lips are blending ñ In a phantom kiss, or two, or three ñ Might as well make believe I love you ñ For to tell the truth ñ I only tell the truth ñ This time I'll tell the truth ñ I do!
Offended a Midget ñ Little guy... I'm not a midget, he's a... he's a child I mean
I found no humor in your laughter; ñ It stole my breath and took real effort ñ To get out of my head and out my lungs ñ I love you so hard ñ It hurts me sometimes ñ  ñ I'm looking back on all of these old notifications ñ But what do they say about me? ñ What do they say about me now? ñ I'm sorry that I'm not exactly what ñ You expected from me ñ Expected from me ñ  ñ I'm usually not this bad at saying that I'm sorry ñ But I'm not sorry, even though you think that I should be ñ That I should be
In agony they writhe ñ The ground runs red with blood ñ Betrayed by the fickle mistress war ñ Impaled on the agony of defeat ñ The smell of death pervades ñ Countless lives the cost of victory ñ The struggle ñ The sweat ñ The blood ñ The blade ñ The strength ñ The carnage ñ The agony of defeat ñ The struggle ñ The sweat ñ The blood ñ The blade ñ The strength ñ The carnage ñ The agony of defeat ñ Your name is defeat (Your name is defeat) ñ (Your name is defeat)
Porsche music like u ridin in a porsche ñ Top back straped up you know it of course ñ Type of sh** that make you think you in a rolls royce ñ They ask me why we do it they act like we had a choice
Well the preacher got drunk ñ He throwed his Bible down ñ He told the congregation ñ I'm Alabama bound ñ I'm Alabama bound ñ I'm Alabama bound ñ If the train don't run ñ I've got a mule to ride ñ Well I've been in New York City ñ And I've been in New York town ñ Good Lord I've been in the mountains ñ With the blues all around ñ Well I jumped in the river ñ And I started to drown ñ I spied a red headed woman ñ Good Lord I couldn't go down
In, out ñ But I know what you are ñ You came, around ñ Still, I know what you are ñ  ñ I could take you downhill for a ride ñ I can take it 'til the end of time ñ  ñ In, out ñ But I know what's in sight ñ It came, around ñ Still, I know what's inside ñ  ñ I can take you downhill for a ride ñ I can take it to the end of the line ñ Oh.. ñ  ñ  ñ In, out ñ But I know what you are ñ You came, around ñ Still, I know what you are ñ  ñ I could take you downhill for a ride, a ride ñ I can take it 'til the end of time..
Making my way back home ñ It's been the longest time ñ Not since I was a little child ñ Have I felt so good and fine ñ The easiest thing I've ever done ñ Like walking through an open door ñ All those things that held me down ñ Well they just don't matter anymore ñ  ñ I wore pretty dresses and teased my hair ñ Sang my heart out in those songs ñ Good or bad, I done my best ñ You can't tell me I was wrong ñ  ñ  ñ I see the shadows of my life ñ Cast upon the level land ñ Rosy lengthening of day ñ Finds my feet in native sand
Once the island lay ñ In between the oceans ñ Peacefully laid to sleep ñ By the waves' harmony ñ Waves kissed softly the shore ñ Ocean's might was held behind ñ Still trying to keep waters ñ Divided from land ñ But by the comets' force ñ The ocean gathered all its strength ñ Tremendous waves invade the lands ñ Cover stones and sand ñ Once the island held ñ Shelter for all life forms ñ Bearing sand and wilderness ñ Now all is swallowed by the sea
Go, going, gone ñ Someone like me right next to me ñ Black is white universal multiplicity ñ Thinking of worlds like bodies of water ñ Closer and they liquify as the data dries ñ Go, going, gone ñ The particle steam is a wave it seems ñ Springing to life alternative things ñ When it breaks free the package arrives ñ Sunk to the current of the current tide ñ Classical things even superstrings ñ Need the movement of data to make them sing ñ Back and forth like a telephone ñ The world at its face is a contiguous data space
Blues stay away from me ñ Blues why don't you let me be ñ I don't know why you keep on haunting me ñ Love was never meant for me ñ True love was never meant for me ñ It seems somehow we never can agree ñ Life is full of misery ñ Dreams are like a memory ñ Bringing back your love that used to be ñ Tears so many I can't see ñ Years don't mean a thing to me ñ Time goes by and still I can't be free
Whoop-dee-frickin'-doo! ñ My best friend is sleeping with my ex behind my back ñ Who cares? ñ I don't! ñ But I could if I wanted--
Lyrics from snippet ñ  ñ Range Rover, whip it like a  (Whip it like a ) ñ All I want is head, I ain't talking school ñ ... ñ You plan on losing, not (Hall nah) ñ  ñ I'm hustling like I ain't got nothin'
Give me the gun ñ I don't care if it's not loaded ñ I'm not here to question your motives ñ But I'm scared for us both ñ I know where your mind goes ñ When you're left alone ñ You're so delicate ñ Admittedly, sometimes I forget ñ You're made of wet paper
You judge me with a closed mind ñ Don't even know me so fucking blind ñ There's only so much lip that I can take ñ End the joke before it gets too late ñ Why do you waste your time hating ñ Blinded and closed I guess you never see
Loved you since Jazz came around ñ The sky is white you color it in blue ñ The leaves rustle as if they are listening to you ñ A marvelous sight, oh who else but you ñ I sit at the corner, stare at those alluring eyes ñ But they never seem to meet me, but why, oh why ñ A step behind you, I am always ñ But you never look back no matter how many days ñ I want a moment where everything is still ñ And there is no speck of a sound ñ That's when i will say it aloud ñ Loved you since Jazz came around
I should like to live forever ñ Suns may rise ñ Suns may set ñ But you and I shall nevermore return to Earth
Riding the night in the high cold winds ñ On the trail of the old lonesome pine ñ Thinking of you, feeling so blue ñ Wondering why you left me behind ñ  ñ Get down boys, go back home ñ Back to the girl you love ñ Treat her right, never wrong ñ How mountain girls can love ñ Remember the night we strolled down the lane ñ Our hearts were gay and happy then ñ You whispered to me as I held your close ñ You hoped this night would never end
I love you, I love you ñ I love you, I love you ñ Love me too, love me too ñ Love me too, love me too ñ I love you, I love you ñ I love you, I love you ñ Love me too, love me too ñ Love me too, love me too
I feel it coming closer ñ The time is here again ñ The night is never over ñ Until we've reached the end ñ I want you to come closer ñ So take my hand ñ Search and we will find ñ Until we meet again
She walks on through the night ñ Her circumstances slight ñ Are only helping her to fail ñ And though she feels she's right ñ She tries with all her might ñ And makes the deepest peril pale ñ Oh, but she is unreal ñ Oh, but she doesn't feel ñ Oh, but she is unreal ñ She chooses who to love ñ And then unlike a dove ñ She takes the laughter from their smile ñ She wears a velvet glove ñ Her friends may find it rough ñ It is a gauntlet all the while ñ Oh, but she is unreal ñ Oh, but she doesn't feel ñ Oh, but she is unreal

Right, this is the Death Blooms demo. ñ This is the actual demo version of the song that we... put together the demos to send out to all the labels and stuff, so this was recorded at Signal Sound Source in Chicago in March through April 1999. ñ This was a song that, uh... that really stuck out to people on that initial demo and just got a lot of buzz going about Mudvayne, so here it is.
In the name of Jesus ñ What have we done ñ Slow death and diseases ñ We're on the run ñ No one will hear you ñ You're on your own ñ No one to save you ñ We all die alone ñ We're better ñ Off dead ñ We're the slaves of evil ñ Where angels weep ñ Escape from my hell ñ You fucking creep ñ We killed our nature ñ We lost all hope ñ Destroy my creature ñ Where is the rope ñ We're better ñ Off dead

Creepers in the halls ñ Behind forbidden walls ñ Under watchful eyes ñ I'm a dirty old man watch out ñ Do you heard that? ñ I don't know... I did ñ Now there's footsteps in the halls ñ And no one hears our calls ñ And the sweat so gently falls ñ Now we're on the run ñ Escape the haunted ones ñ Now there's blood stains in the halls ñ See the traces on the walls ñ Inside here a demon crawls ñ He's a dirty old man ñ You better watch out
Land of the free, home of the brave ñ To the system we exist and as slaves to our trades ñ Power to the people or the machine on top ñ As the life of the working man starts and stops ñ Power to the people or the machines that we are ñ Real control is at the hands of political czars ñ Land...of...the...free... ñ We must make the mission impossible, mission unstoppable ñ Painting by numbers, unfinished, unclear. too late, apocalypse is here
Oh Lord You have shown Your favour ñ Your every word stands true ñ I'm found safe within in Your harbour ñ Anchored deep in You ñ You washed away my tears ñ Gave me joy and freedom ñ Lifting me through the years ñ Your love is stronger than ñ The sound of heaven's praises ñ Higher than ñ The lofty mountain peaks ñ Deeper than ñ The deepest ocean valleys ñ Strong enough for me
We'll build a fortress ñ To keep them out ñ And in a world gone silent ñ I'll be your sound ñ Meet me tonight here ñ I know we're gotta run away ñ Leaving the old fear ñ Looking for a new place ñ I can feel a storm near ñ The dream won't go away ñ So meet me tonight dear ñ And we'll run into a new day ñ And through it all ñ I'm on your side now ñ I'm on your side now ñ We'll build a fortress ñ To keep them out ñ And in a world gone silent ñ I'll be your sound ñ And if they try to hurt you ñ I'll tear them down ñ I'm always with you now
Night descended like a blanket, on the house ñ Where I miss you like a limb ñ I close the curtains, shun the working and ñ I put your record on ñ I, the lonely tax collector, never had ñ Such a feeling before you came ñ You descended, I amended ñ And I need it like a hole in the head ñ You took me to the lion's den ñ And waited for the beast to begin

The stars on horizon ñ Five I see them and count ñ They line up like a row of heads ñ And I fall into their depths ñ Of water water everywhere ñ Oh let me fall into you ñ Let me sleep long and quiet ñ God watches all sparrows fall ñ Both for ñ Thanks ñ The cat is dead ñ Thank you oh worthwhile thing to pray ñ Loud and often ñ So sweepy silent ñ That small bubble my dream ñ Burst last night ñ It was bloodful ñ So full but when it split ñ I was blinded ñ Those with feelings ñ Wonderous kind ñ Our love with kittens ñ Everbind
Look at me now. full on the run. i can't stop myself from crashing. breaking grass, bumming a yard. fixing stuff that was never broken. pulling out all the stops. i'm gonna puck on the cops. i'm telling the kids, punk rocks. i'm gonna puke on cops. gimme a side of airplane noise or a half a glass of our resistance. add a dash of disobedient public nusant, richtor riot. pulling out all the stops. i'm gonna puck on the cops. i'm telling the kids, punk rocks. i'm gonna puke on cops
Another she will anyway ñ Colliding in old photographs ñ Some other candy matrimony ñ It strips the mind's eye free ñ  ñ (Everywhere at one time) ñ Maybe next time ñ  ñ Tread wire on jaded memory ñ Against every line I know ñ Break through harmony ñ I threw my wish in there ñ It set my mind's eye free ñ  x2
It's just past four ñ And we're on your porch ñ There you are with a smile ñ We'll follow you in ñ These moments I thought we'd be repeating ñ How could I have known they'd be so fleeting ñ Talented and kind, passionate, sincere ñ After only days it feels like we've been friends for years ñ A senseless act and now you're gone
Force your opinions on the mind of the young ñ Feeding poison to hungry souls ñ Prepare them for their self-destruction ñ Laughing as you watch them (die) ñ Lie to me your lie ñ  ñ Make your own concept of what's right and what's wrong ñ Feeding poison to hungry souls ñ Take what you want, not what you're needing ñ Your day of judgment draweth nigh ñ  ñ (Demoralize) Converting millions to your lies ñ (Demoralize) Your day of judgment draweth nigh ñ  ñ (Demoralize) ñ (Demoralize) ñ Demoralize ñ Demoralize ñ "Follow us."
In the spirit I saw a throne through an open door ñ Emerald rainbow adorned the mighty seat that I saw ñ There were thrones they seated elders robed in white ñ Flashes, peals of thunder surround the throne of light ñ He shall reign forever ñ He shall reign forever ñ Creatures worship day and night they never cease ñ Elders fall down cast their crowns at his feet ñ Seven torches blazing with seven spirits in ñ Sea of glass like crystal before the throne of him
That good old feel
I am my father's son ñ A mile-wide mean streak through me runs ñ What I deserve, what's lived gets learned ñ Connections cut, loyalties turned ñ Born to destroy ñ My knives are praying in delirious thirst ñ In cancer city I am the cursed, I'm at my best when things are worst ñ The sharpest tongues cut their own throats first ñ Born to destroy
Ooh, ma ñ Ooh, pa ñ Who's so sorry now? ñ Ooh, pa ñ Ooh, ma ñ Am I really on show? ñ Wild eyed in the spotlight? ñ Fuck me, what a nightmare, who's there? ñ Have they all gone? ñ It's okay now you're in luck ñ The worms have fled the rising sun ñ Their evil power is on the way ñ Forget the past and start again ñ There must be some mistake ñ I didn't mean to let them take away my soul ñ Am I too old? ñ Is it too late? ñ Ooh, ma ñ Ooh pa ñ Who's so sorry now? ñ Ooh, pa ñ Ooh, ma ñ Who's so sorry now? ñ Ooh, ah!

Sometimes it appears that were reaching a ñ Period when our senses and our minds will ñ No longer respond to ñ Moderate stimulation ñ  ñ We stand today ñ On one of the strange commentary's of human history ñ Nearly half the span of human life ñ We have seen a series of wars ñ Revolutions ñ Depressions ñ Cruelty and suffering ñ And finally another conflagration that has engulfed the world
Got a little ghost ñ In my hand ñ Hes too small to scare ñ It seems no one cares ñ All that he can do ñ Is a tiny little boo ñ Boo
I've got time on my hands ñ Since you took your heart away from me ñ It's the only love I really want ñ Endlessness of pain sinking in ñ While thoughts are caving in ñ Suddenly summer moved on ñ Gone with its meaning ñ Suddenly all that I have known ñ A world with no home ñ Denied years of memories ñ No future, no hope ñ Suddenly summer moved on ñ Summer moved on
We keep the heat off ñ So we can save ñ The cold wakes me up ñ An invisible wave ñ I think in my dream ñ I was unbuttoning ñ The back ñ Of your lavender dress
Raise your cups mountain pirates ñ Let's stop and have a drink ñ And observe a moment's silence ñ We all need some time to think ñ We've had a long hard day ñ Unassuming, unafraid ñ We bared our skin and bone ñ And we climbed atop this stone ñ So let us lie, Mountain Pirates ñ And look up at the stars ñ Because I know that we are tired ñ But we've found out who we are ñ And upon this bed of dirt ñ We'll pacify the hurt ñ Upon this precipice ñ We know just what living is
He had a heart-attack, Mac ñ They shot him full of smack ñ He overdosed 'fore he understood ñ Anything at all ñ They forgot before long ñ Put their black righteous cloaks back on ñ They never cared about anything ñ Anything at all (X3) ñ They called it rat poison suicide ñ And put his ashes in a jar ñ Without name or number ñ And no remorse at all ñ With a mouth full of psychodorm ñ The herd sticks to their guards ñ And their factory routine ñ In anything and all (X3)
You say... ñ That you are full of anger there is nothing to believe in ñ You won't believe in God that He is just a mythical fairy tale ñ Then you can tell me something ñ What put life into the lifeless? ñ I say if you are full of anger ñ I say if anger is not in me ñ God has replaced it with fulfillment ñ I say what is better to believe? ñ Then you can tell me something ñ What put life into the lifeless? ñ What is the reason we are here ñ Is it all ebcause of an accident?
We scintillate like cedar stones ñ In plasma veil as ancient ones ñ In cold war years you were my fears ñ But just to gain the power to reign ñ Satan's bllod in our veins ñ The pigfaced mud will be slayn ñ But noone dies when blackseas dry ñ And noone kill. forever this will ñ Our wisdom be ñ Now you're asking ñ What are you living for ñ No sense of life ñ And none afterwards ñ What I call wisdom is a flower ñ That can seldom be found ñ But not in illusions ñ You only use to find ñ A way out
I see a swallow perched in front of me ñ Laughing with her eyes so sullenly ñ Then I see a truck go down the way ñ No delivery for me today ñ There's a man upon a little bike ñ That makes him feel so big he can't decide ñ If he should give up scraping both his knees ñ For the sake of being so discreet ñ So discreet ñ Before I know it I am far away ñ The swallow looks so small she can't complain ñ I don't remember which warm house is mine ñ So I choose the one whose love is fine ñ Love is fine
Gone ñ The cold, shut eye ñ That is the enemy ñ While I'm gone you are my open eyes ñ Call back the shadows I tried to forget ñ Though I can't remember anything, you...you're there
What will your friends say? ñ They say your problems only fade away ñ Like yesterday ñ If you close your eyes ñ They'll talk about you ñ I'm sure the things they say are never true ñ That's just like you ñ But please don't cry ñ  ñ  ñ What will your friends say? ñ They say your problems only fade away ñ Like yesterday ñ If you close your eyes ñ They'll mention your name ñ I'm sure the things they say are never true ñ That's just like you ñ But please don't cry
Born ñ Into a pack ñ There's no choice ñ But take orders to attack ñ Locked up in chains ñ I get fed ñ But the hunger still remains ñ Not content to live this way ñ Being led by the blind ñ Got to plan my dispersal ñ Time to leave them all behind ñ Breaking out of my pain ñ Nothing ventured, nothing gained ñ I'm my own master now ñ Bear the mark of my scars ñ Shedding blood underneath the stars ñ But I will survive somehow ñ Ooo ñ Ooo ñ Hear me howl ñ Time to leave them all behind ñ I'm my own master now
Give me a gun, give me a knife ñ Give me a needle or I'll take my life ñ The pain is killing, my stomach hurts ñ My nerves are shaking, the dope is inside ñ Blow my brain out, kill the lust ñ But still there is a feeling, I need more at last ñ Everyday is the same ñ Try to break the hours of the day ñ The criminal part, you don't really care ñ You just need the feeling, ou want to be there ñ You don't need no sleep, you don't need to eat ñ You just need the people, who give your needs

What would you give for an escape ñ For freedom ñ For complete liberty ñ This is a small group of people ñ Who haved shared a vision in common ñ You above everyone else should understand ñ We can not be free until we have power ñ How else can we achieve it
Would you throw a weasel in the wind sometime ñ A forgotten space in the back of your mind ñ I don't care, no ñ It's so hard to remember ñ I've been waiting in this so long ñ When it comes, will it all be right? ñ Running like a renegade ñ I don't care, no ñ It's so hard to remember ñ And so feel it coming now ñ Pushing upward and through the ground ñ To be there waiting for you

Nothing can change the things I did ñ Nothing can force your body to live ñ Trapped! ñ I'm trapped! ñ Trapped, ignore the fact ñ Trapped, inside your head ñ Trapped, you can't get free ñ Trapped, by society

Your face so beautiful it makes me cry ñ I was not thinking I would get this high ñ But here I am mesmerized ñ Life gets heavy but bright ñ Deeper blue, crystallized ñ I'm so weak, so alive ñ Mesmerized ñ A light appearing in my broken sky ñ Night falls around me as the stars shoot by ñ While here I stand mesmerized ñ Life gets heavy but bright ñ Deeper blue, crystallized ñ I'm so weak, so alive ñ Mesmerized
I can see a room, a place for me and you ñ The windows aren't painted shut ñ And the sheets are new ñ We won't bother anyone and ñ Everyone will just let us be ñ In the city and we'll have enough money ñ So that our lives, they'll be almost easy ñ You'll walk me to work and ñ Pick me up in the evening ñ We'll walk along the avenues and ñ Have dinner at any place we choose ñ And all the scars I have I'll no longer see ñ They won't even be a distant memory ñ I can finally see a place for you and me
It's all good ñ It's all good ñ It's all good ñ It's all good ñ It's all good ñ It's all good ñ It's all good ñ It's all good ñ It's all good ñ It's all good ñ It's all good
Beginnings of something to come ñ Spark in the eye better do not cry ñ Now look aside of each dark dream ñ Here he lurks in there waiting to be seen ñ The Duke of death, I'm the duke of death

I heard the rain ñ As it skipped and rolled down the pane ñ Sleep was almost here ñ But I stirred from not having you near ñ We were apart ñ For the first time since you'd claimed my heart ñ I said your name ñ And I knew we would burn like a flame ñ Now twenty years have gone ñ And I know how much I've done you wrong ñ I caused you pain ñ And I know that things can't be the same ñ But my love has a name ñ And it's yours and it burns like a flame

Last chance to escape ñ Shall I forsake all that I can take to carry on ñ Insanity slips away ñ Greeting the new day ñ Believing is kneeling ñ Ignore what i'm feeling ñ The pressure of living is taking it's toll ñ Regrets that i'm thinking ñ The hope that we're sharing is a lost cause ñ Mishappen ñ Thought i'd lost ñ Caressing chaos drops ñ Prelude to a drowning, burning vision ñ Pointless, selfish ñ Half the time I can't remember any ñ Of the childish lies ñ Suppressing unwanted thoughts ñ Expressing my only choice

As I was drowning,creeping,crawling ñ I said my last goodbye ñ And even if it's ending it's hurting ñ I don't know why ñ And as i was slowly closing my eyes ñ I felt the need to say i'm sorry ñ And even if it's small and sad ñ This is my story...
Everybody helps me make my own mistakes ñ If I'm left alone I'd make them anyway ñ Great events, but can't predict ñ What's happening in present tense ñ No reference in code to me ñ Everybody helps me make my own mistakes ñ If I'm left alone I'd make them anyway
There's no way you can see it ñ I'm acting like everything's cool ñ But, hell, I'm about to burst ñ Got two delicate options ñ Either I zip of the venom ñ Or else I will die of thirst ñ Down, going down to my inner revolution ñ Revolution inside ñ Got a nice little conflict ñ A riot inside my head ñ I'm at war with myself all alone ñ My eyes tell you nothing ñ But I'm closing in on myself ñ And it scares me to the bone ñ Down, going down to my inner revolution ñ Revolution inside

I was lost in the world of dreams ñ Counting every star ñ Shining overhead it seems ñ I was like a shepherd boy ñ Searching for his lamb ñ Here and there and everywhere ñ You came, whoa yeah, you captured me ñ You and all your charms ñ Oh yes, you set me free ñ We kissed and the world was ours alone ñ And my heart cried ñ Oh, I love you so ñ Then my heart cried ñ Oh, I love you so ñ Then my heart cried ñ Oh, I love you so ñ Love you so ñ Love you so

Life is hard ñ Work is dirty ñ Friends plead poverty ñ Fame and fortune ñ Keeps its own time ñ So don't wait up ñ But if you can feel the sun ñ If you can feel the rain ñ Life can't be bad ñ If you've got food to eat ñ And all your dreams to dream ñ Life can't be bad ñ If you can walk away ñ And fight another day ñ Life can't be that bad ñ For all the things that I can do ñ How could I complain ñ I've got no broken wings ñ I've got a heart that sings ñ And I feel blessed
Sin is so much more than poetry ñ Better start to pray ñ Crime is sensual ñ Softly breathing down your neck ñ Flooded chemistry ñ A tempting sign ñ Is showing us ñ A glimpse of alchemy ñ The curtain drops ñ Whenever we do try ñ To react as if we're one ñ Poisoned arrow softly piercing my heart ñ With poetry ñ Watching the sunrise ñ My eyes closing fast ñ Swallowed by the sea ñ One music doll stops rotating, breaking ñ Her song lingers on ñ Translating

I want to see you again ñ Finding out where you've been ñ I want to see you again ñ Finding out where you've been ñ I want to see you again ñ Finding out where you've been ñ These words will never find you ñ If they do they'll pass through you ñ Like wind through the pylons ñ Like snow in a warm pond ñ They will disappear ñ They will disappear ñ I want to see you again ñ Far away from here ñ I want to run away ñ Where the stars can't seem to find me ñ Where they shine so far behind me ñ Shine behind me ñ Far behind me
Good clean fun, we don't hurt no one ñ And I like to know where I can get mine ñ I'd like to know where I can get mine ñ Good clean fun, never hurt no one ñ And I'd like to know where I can get mine ñ Like to know where I can get mine ñ Good clean fun ñ Good clean fun ñ Good clean fun ñ Good clean fun ñ So don't say I have a one track mind ñ It's over that I know what I like ñ It's over that I know what I like ñ (Chorus x2)
Waving hands, waving hands ñ Waving goodbye, it never ends ñ The story's over, and I don't want no tears ñ The story's over, we wasted a few years ñ  ñ  ñ Happy people, happy house ñ Making new friends, now we're apart ñ The story's over, and we are on our own ñ The story's over, it's good to be alone ñ  ñ  ñ Waving hands, waving hands ñ Waving goodbye, it never ends ñ The story's over, and I don't want no tears ñ The story's over, we wasted a few years
Might gone off too far by now ñ Beaten up in a mental sense ñ There's no way to understand ñ Hate needs words and love needs sounds ñ Like that guy that shoots himself ñ Drags us all down into it ñ Lost and drowned in our own tumult ñ It's depressing but it's healing, too
Strange winds blow in the atmosphere ñ Strange winds filling our hearts with fear ñ For the day that's to come for us ñ For the days, that are gone ñ Storm is raging, it sounds like war ñ Please make sure that you've Locked your door ñ Stay inside and stay calm ñ Lay your head on my arm ñ Not the end of the world ñ You see they'll go on ñ Without you and me, I will always be there ñ For you I will always be true
It felt like rain ñ That fell again ñ Down on me ñ It felt like rain ñ That touched my face ñ And I can't believe it ñ Like rain ñ I can't believe it ñ No I can't believe it ñ The things You said ñ Seem to find their way back into my head ñ And I regret my ways ñ You never left ñ Remind me once again so I won't forget ñ You're never far away ñ It felt like rain ñ That said again ñ That it's okay ñ Pale like white ñ I close my eyes ñ 'Cause I can't believe it ñ I can't believe it ñ The way You forgive me
Take what you want ñ It's a hollow victory ñ Make me wonder ñ What it was for ñ Think how you feel ñ If it were you instead of me ñ Makes me wonder ñ What it was for ñ Don't you have everything you want? ñ Don't you have everything you need? ñ Still you take what's mine from me ñ Now, can we... ñ Don't you have everythin' you could want? ñ Don't you have everythin' you could need? ñ Still you take what's mine from me ñ And I can't... ñ Please, don't push me around ñ I can't fight you openly ñ Makes me wonder ñ What it was for
Coming soon or please add them!
Titles of a song ñ That fly among the tracking of time ñ Capturing emotions in a song ñ On and on ñ Forever ñ A fire on a beach ñ Your friends ñ A moment locked in a tune ñ Emotions last forever in a song all life long ohoo ñ Acqua azzurra o alba chiara ñ Nel blu dipinto di blu ñ Cosa restera ñ Un centro di gravita ñ Acqua azzurra o alba chiara ñ E di una terra promessa ñ Cosa restera ñ Un centro di gravita... indifferente
(Missing Lyrics)
If I could have it back ñ All the time that we wasted ñ I'd only waste it again ñ If I could have it back ñ You know I would love to waste it again ñ Waste it again and again and again ñ I forgot to ask ñ  ñ Sometimes I can't believe it ñ I'm moving past the feeling again ñ Sometimes I can't believe it ñ I'm moving past the feeling again
Fuck your ideas of what's hardcore, fuck your safe prepackaged shit. Fuck your best selling, queer-bashing artists. Fuck this as a commodity. You say you own it when you say what is hardcore, or why we're hardcore. Marketing a movement, for you it's just 'moving units.' Fifteen dollar*, long-sleeve T-shirts, glossy full-page advertisements, promotional 'one-sheets' of what's coming soon, all toilet paper for me and my crew
The northern warriors pray ñ The hurted bodies raise ñ TYR God of war they praise ñ He's really proud to fall ñ Fall under the sharp blade ñ The only way to die ñ They vowed to die arms in hand (in hand) ñ Valhalla joy's waiting for them ñ White-armed maidens named ñ The choosers of the slain ñ Will take them to the Reign ñ They fill the Heroes horns ñ Someone looks like a skull ñ The drink of Gods they taste ñ Fightin' hardly the Heroes die ñ But the wounds are healed ñ Feasting the Heroes days ñ They will live forever ñ Oh, Oh
I'm going to put you in the hospital ñ People pay attention to me ñ I don't know why ñ You will learn to love me ñ I don't know why ñ We will make history ñ I don't know why ñ People pay attention to me
Twenty Thirteen ñ Oh what a night ñ The DJ moved the crowd ñ Twenty Thirteen ñ Still in my heart ñ The music and the stars ñ Oh, Twenty Thirteen ñ Oh what a night we've had ñ And we were cheering for bass lines ñ And slurred rolls, and they'd sell some smoke ñ Oh magic ñ And they were bringing us trays of wine ñ And any kind of alcohol and coke ñ Twenty Thirteen ñ Oh what a night we've had ñ Memories we share will live on, and on, and on, and on... ñ And on and on and on and on, and that's the end of the song
And when the morning came ñ I found myself the enclave ñ Of a tiny darkened space ñ And no one here to blame ñ There's a burden in the back ñ I'm the body in the bag ñ There's a muffled sound I hear ñ When the tires stop it's clear ñ It sounds like London ñ There's a burden in the back ñ I'm the body in the bag ñ Tiny darkened space
Tryin' not to look in my direction ñ Fearin' that our eyes might meet ñ I think you know the consequence of that connection ñ You wind up somewhere naked with me ñ  ñ So you resist, my offences ñ Play hard to get, all you like ñ  ñ But girl i know you want it ñ Girl you don't have to act like you don't ñ Baby, I know you want it ñ Stop frontin' and come get what you want ñ Come get what you want, babe ñ Hey, come get what you want ñ Yeah baby ñ I love y'all ñ See ya soon
Teen Angel, Angel Divine ñ Teen Angel, Angel of Mine ñ How I love you ñ How I need you ñ For my own ñ Teen Angel, Open your heart ñ Teen Angel, we'll never part ñ How I long ñ How I yearn ñ For you my dear ñ For you my dear ñ Hold me baby ñ Never let me go ñ Tell me you love me ñ Tell me that it's so ñ We'll be together ñ Forever and ever ñ On earth and ñ In heaven above ñ Teen Angel, Angel Divine ñ Teen Angel, Angel of Mine ñ Our love is young ñ Now we are one ñ Teen Angel... ñ Teen Angel...
Thin veil of innocence ñ Can't smother the flames ñ Of this angry atmosphere ñ We're all insane
You're always dancing down the street ñ With your suede blue eyes ñ And every new boy that you meet ñ He doesn't know the real surprise ñ Here she comes again ñ When she's dancing 'neath the starry sky ñ She'll make you flip ñ Here she comes again ñ When she's dancing 'neath the starry sky ñ You kinda like the way she dips ñ She's my best friend's girl ñ She's my best friend's girl ñ And she used to be mine ñ You've got your nuclear boots ñ And your drip dry glove ñ And when you bite your lip ñ It's some reaction to love
It's time to shut off ñ It's time to turn down ñ It's time to get lost ñ I must turn me around ñ To lessen the pain ñ To broaden the truth ñ To dispose of no gain ñ I haven't the proof ñ To keep me from falling back ñ To keep me from letting go ñ To keep me from holding onto myself ñ The era has ended ñ The time has come ñ It will be so splendid ñ We've only just begun ñ To keep me from falling back ñ To keep me of letting go ñ To teach me from holding onto myself
Memories of yesterday ñ Just can't seem to wash them away ñ You made me feel okay ñ You're the reason I got up everyday ñ Rest assured ñ I insure ñ The best way to let it go ñ Lies ahead, for I haven't found it yet ñ Just thought I'd let you know ñ In this abyss ñ You're the one I miss ñ Second star to the right ñ Ships passing in the night ñ You don't know ñ You don't care ñ If only you saw what I see ñ You'd know this isn't fair
I am the hype!
Amongst the books, an angel I've not met ñ And time hasn't touched her yet ñ From a to m to z she swans, as if avoiding bed ñ Pigtails instead of wings ñ I strung her harp with my heart strings ñ And I would ask this spring for her ñ If I knew what the right words were
I could see you from the avenue ñ Across the air a motor run ñ Redder than a tail light ñ Love is coming down ñ Love is coming down ñ Love is coming down ñ I could see you on the sunset ñ Like red blood poring down ñ I can feel a bead of cold sweat ñ Love is coming down ñ Love is coming down ñ Love is coming down
So you've waited long for this ñ A deep awakening comes in to sweep your sorry eyes ñ Where there once was absent thoughts, now pictures intervene ñ And from those memories you've got, you've found a way to finally see that ñ Love is just the tail of a jet black swan ñ Captured images of light ñ They remind us not to blink or shy away our souls ñ Can't imagine all the pain you've been living with ñ I'm not sorry in the least for the things I never did because ñ Love is just the tail of a jet black swan
I was like 13 ñ And it was a Sunday morning I think... ñ And... ñ I think both of my parents were still asleep... ñ I remember.. ñ I was gonna play sick so I wouldn't have to go to church that day... ñ And I turned over ñ And there he was... ñ Holding a pillow... ñ He smelled of sweat... and regret ñ .... and he said .... ñ "shhhhh"
Lyrics from Snippet ñ  ñ Won't until it take me ñ The devil weak, the devil weak ñ Devil thought I  ñ Bought her a ceiling ñ I've been back from addiction ñ I done beat they prediction...
My house in Budapest, my ñ My hidden treasure chest ñ Golden grand piano ñ My beautiful Castillo ñ You, ooh, you, ooh ñ I'd leave it all
(Chorus: Tommy Wright III) ñ I wanna commit a murder, murder ñ I wanna witness a murder, murder ñ I wanna be part of a murder, murder ñ I love premeditated murder, murder ñ (Repeats one more time) ñ (Verse 1: Tommy Wright III)
I see you in a lonely place ñ How can you be so blind ñ You're still regretting the love you left, left behind ñ Oh darling, I've seen you go through the changes ñ Sitting alone each night ñ Are you expecting to find love ñ A love that's right ñ Darling, open your eyes
I Am Immortal ñ I Stand Alone ñ Thy Legions Falling ñ Thy Kingdom Come ñ The Flesh Has Risen ñ The Gate Of Light Is Sealed ñ Your Mourning Era ñ Touches Velvet Steel ñ All Rise For... ñ All Stand For... ñ All Hail For... ñ All Bleed For...
Hailing the last crusade ñ Solving the plans we've made ñ Deeming we are heaven sent ñ There is nothing to repent ñ Destroy the world to save it ñ Amerce who have to acquit ñ See what you are fighting for ñ This is total war ñ Marching through ashes of our own ñ Leaving a trace of ruins and bloody bones ñ We divide good from evil ñ Ignoring the dirt at our steeple ñ Stalking through a wasted land ñ This is our bitter end
I was down  run me up a check, yeah
My boy lollipop ñ You made my heart go giddy up ñ You are as sweet as candy; ñ You're my sugar dandy ñ Ho, ho, my boy lollipop ñ Never ever leave me ñ Because it would grieve me; ñ My heart told me so ñ I love ya, I love ya, I love ya so ñ That I want ya to know ñ I need ya, I need ya, I need ya so ñ And I'll never let you go ñ My boy lollipop ñ You make my heart go giddy up ñ You set my world on fire ñ You are my one desire ñ My boy lollipop ñ My boy lollipop
(Instrumental) ñ ("Actions Speak Louder" was composed as the theme for the documentary film "The Greenpeace Years.")
My voice dissipates ñ My anger dominates ñ I cry inside, hurting all those in line ñ Never feel, I never feel ñ I fall into silent upheaval ñ Drained, gasp my last breath ñ Ravaged, hurting to set them in place ñ Delusion and rage ñ Need to be one contained ñ Need to slow down, take hold ñ Hope in need, time alone please ñ Delusion and rage ñ Headstrong where is my grace ñ Cry like the wind ñ Only answer is within
Streets flow into water so clumsy and perfect I threw my decoder ring away each night frame and hang it up golden shade on everything touch kills me eyes bring me
Time it was ñ And what a time it was ñ It was a time of innocence ñ A time of confidences ñ Long ago, it must be ñ I have a photograph ñ Preserve your memories ñ They're all that's left you
I talk to planets baby ñ AAAAARGH!
The universe hangs like a necklace from God ñ Jewels suspended in the cosmos ñ And it makes me believe ñ This is how we're meant to be ñ Cause we're just-
Here I am back home again ñ I'm here to rest ñ All they ask is where I've been ñ Knowing I've been West ñ  ñ I'm the family's unowned boy ñ Golden curls of envied hair ñ Pretty girls with faces fair ñ See the shine in the Black Sheep Boy ñ  ñ If you love me you'll let me live in peace ñ Please understand ñ That the Black Sheep can wear the golden fleece ñ And hold a winning hand
Silent ceremonies rendering the ages ñ I turn around and see your eyes ñ Shining out the love ñ Engraved with confidence and faith ñ The promises we made and betrayed ñ Silent ceremonies rendering the ages ñ I close my eyes and see your face ñ Showing the despair ñ And worn with memories of loss ñ The roads that we have crossed ñ On our way to freedom ñ Silent ceremonies rendering the ages ñ I see a star in every sky ñ Shining out the love ñ Embraced by memories of bliss ñ The joy that we caressed in a hazy daydream
You leave your world just so far away ñ But that's ok you can frown today ñ Just let it slide ñ Will you hang around just for the last round ñ With your crystal cane that you swing around ñ Just let it slide ñ Well is your world just so hard to fake ñ Well that's ok you can laugh today ñ Just let is slide
(Outro) ñ I don't feel wrong to think about it ñ But I think about whatever I like ñ Tryna control these thoughts ñ Think about, think whatever the time ñ You'll never be mine, I'll never control these thoughts ñ Think about, think whatever the time ñ You'll never be mine, I'll never control these thoughts ñ Think about, think whatever the time ñ You'll never be mine, I'll never control these thoughts ñ Think about, think whatever the time ñ You'll never be mine
Served up in the backyard ñ Cooked too long on high ñ Flying out the window ñ Even dogs have passed them by ñ Didn't know she was tied up ñ Better fed than forced ñ Time to meet the protagonist, boy ñ He never showed remorse ñ Choking on the one thing ñ His tongue had gotten too fat ñ A barely walking dead man ñ Seemed to know where he was at ñ Drive himself to the airport ñ Getting out of here ñ Overworking the small town ñ The law couldn't get too near
One day you will be mine ñ The clouds will part the sun will shine ñ One day you will be mine ñ One day you will arise ñ To see the stars within my eyes ñ One day you will be mine ñ (repeat first)
Screaming out loud. I loved everyone. I never meant to hurt anyone. just as the nails of so many man before Me, drove through My skin. it seemed to silence His lips. for no one really cared. He then let out a cry that was heard for miles and miles. His love joined in with cries of love. screaming at the top of Her lungs. screaming for something pure. pure emotional love. the kind that cannot quiet Her lips

Whoever said that, big boys don't cry ñ You say you never shed a tear ñ Well, listen, that's a lie ñ We're all defenseless ñ When it comes to pain ñ I said boys and girls alike, yeah ñ We're all the same ñ It's my party, and I'll cry if I want to ñ Big boys don't cry ñ As if nothing seems to matter ñ Big boys don't cry ñ Then why do I ñ Big boys don't cry ñ Because nothing in this world ever matters ñ Big boys don't cry ñ Hey, I'm not ashamed ñ To say a tear is in my eye ñ Because another tear will take its place ñ Before I die
I propose a toast ñ To the hostess with the most ñ And I raise my glass to you ñ With the bubbly of the poor ñ Brut 33 or 34 ñ With a vintage of 1972 ñ With the same name ñ As a London railway station you were cursed ñ To always keep on moving ñ When Jesus wants you for a sunbeam ñ And the devil gets there first ñ You're cruising for a bruising ñ Sold down the river ñ By so many guys ñ Always the bridesmaid ñ Never the bride ñ If someone up there likes you ñ Then someone up there lied ñ Because no one down here tried
The shadow of your smile ñ When you are gone ñ Will color all my dreams ñ And light the dawn ñ Look into my eyes ñ My love, and see ñ All the lovely things ñ You are to me ñ Our wistful little star ñ Was far too high ñ A teardrop kissed your lips ñ And so did I ñ Now, when I remember spring ñ All the joy that love can bring ñ I will be remembering ñ The shadow of your smile

Well, set coordinates for, ah ñ Chocolate City, and have a landing party of nine men beam down ñ Immiediately, with phasers set on funk-funk!

Me! Just me! All for me ñ I spent a lifetime scheming for me ñ Teaching and preaching and preening for me ñ I built a fortress around my fears ñ Dispatched grim sorties against facticity ñ I live without you, sealed by "virtue" ñ Founded on deceit ñ Inner music, though sweet, will never be ñ Complete ñ The last light reveals all insights ñ As effigies and mirrors, strung up in flight ñ Blood seeks the earth ñ Flesh concedes ñ Memories of vauntery can't impede ñ The greater need ñ Sacrifice completes the partial life
I'm lying here, oh so peaceful ..... ñ ..... In serene harmony ñ I'm dreaming yet I feel awake ñ I'm dreaming yet I am awake ñ Subjected to pain. Dark screams repent ñ And in a foreboding rage, a soul will die ..... ñ ..... a soul will die ñ My mind is burning, I'm burning ñ I can't feel you anymore ñ Have I reached my point? ñ Will I drown in delusion? ñ The winds fell silent ñ And in my cerulean twilight ñ I left myself once again ñ ..... it's overwhelming ñ Suffer yourself, and let me die here awhile
I'm fed up, listening to you I'm fed up, about ñ What's hot and new I'm fed up, with what I hear ñ And see I'm so bloody sick of being me ñ Mad bad n' pissed

I waited for an answer - an answer never came ñ And as I sat and stared in my golden chair - ñ All the trees still looked the same ñ And the clouds still blurred the sunshine ñ And the rain un-wrote my name ñ  ñ But there were birds flocking
It's a joke I play three times a day ñ To sticky magazines ñ Tired wrist and greasy fist ñ Erotic sister scenes ñ Bitter, unreal, too worn out to feel ñ Resisting, grasping and never lasting ñ And nulling out my pleasure ñ So I never know what's real ñ Three times a day, three times I see ñ Just how pathetic my need can be ñ  ñ "You got it, brother"
Lyrics from Snippet ñ  ñ Don't you love a good rollercoaster? ñ My favorite part is the drop ñ Love the rush as it's getting closer ñ Why would I want it to stop? ñ Uphill battles leave me so out of breath ñ But cruising back down is a breeze ñ It's like driving reckless real fast down the canyon ñ And seeing the lights through the trees ñ Oh, just like you and me ñ We're going down fast ñ 'Cause we both know that we weren't built to last ñ But the view is always better on the way down
While they lined up to wait ñ On Black Friday ñ In a panic with shopping bags ñ There were magazine racks ñ Of cruel attacks ñ Seven new ways to please your man ñ  ñ She's everywhere you look ñ Everywhere you look ñ  ñ Well she wanted to dance but lost her chance ñ Now she feels like a waste of space ñ On an island you might be in your mind ñ But your soul won't be cast away ñ  ñ She's everywhere you look ñ Everywhere you look ñ  ñ Here she comes ñ You're above it ñ You wanted it all
The dirt up to my eyes ñ Lungs about to collapse ñ Skin begins to break ñ Embedded in the earth ñ Time could never heal ñ The wounds inflicted deep ñ Years of abuse ñ Quietly self-induced ñ Life portrays a silence ñ A calm wind of sorts ñ Pale faces pass ñ In this quiet hell found cold ñ Years of abuse ñ Bound my thoughts ñ The memories of old ñ One with myself ñ Frail and damned within ñ Enthroned in silence ñ Split down the middle ñ Beneath your gaping flesh ñ Broken over me
Man has given a false importance to death ñ Every animal, plant, or man that dies adds to nature's compost heap ñ Becomes the manure without which nothing could grow ñ Man has given a false importance to death ñ Every animal, plant, or man that dies adds to nature's compost heap ñ Becomes the manure without which nothing could grow, nothing could be created ñ Death is simply part of the process ñ Every death, even the cruelest death, drowns in total indifference to nature

No solid foundation for the suffering, we inflict useless pain. A sacrifice for profit, fulfilling the quota, nothing is gained. Denounce the role that animals play. Why do they die? Selfish lust imprisoned by your vanity, cleansed with guilt. In these tests the subjects always fail, needlessly they die. Images of pain squeeze through your narrow mind. What does the human race gain? (Are we so obsessed with death that we can not break free from its grips?)

An unfamiliar stage where you'd rather stay ñ A meditation plan when you sway and sink ñ I want a fine downtown for the caroler who sounds ñ Like quiet when the sun goes down ñ I swear I'll be alright, although Emily's in the sky ñ She waters the ground with gin, she pours me out ñ Onto the shadow of her home-state tree ñ She's not ready to let it be ñ In awe with the medals you burned for someone's heart ñ A scene I kept dreaming made me swollen and sharp
Infinity is just a changeless quality of the mind ñ And within that changeless quality, everything arises ñ If we talk about space, we think, "it's infinite." ñ And our mind is often compared to space ñ There's gonna be an end... ñ If there's an end, there's a beginning ñ If there's one universe finishing ñ There'll be another one starting

Once I feared I could not kill, I've seen their eyes evolve into mine. They prayed to one, it felt oh, so quaint, for pain to become their patron Saint. On this holy ground is where secrets end. When death is an equal friend. We have only tangled the ties that bind. I followed a messiah when I was blind. See the river of time twisting in front of me

Killing hurts ñ It has to be done ñ Peace and love ñ Who's number one? ñ The right to give ñ Learn to bleed, it's free ñ Pain is outside ñ Lift it up to see ñ Step ahead ñ Always wear the past ñ Dying, soothe me ñ Beneath the smell of grass ñ No world secret ñ Kept is too intent ñ I've got my nerve ñ Self-help, self-help confidence ñ Confidence ñ Confidence ñ Confidence ñ  ñ Confidence ñ Confidence ñ Confidence

Hanging with my friends every Saturday night. Throwing stuff at bums, a few looking to fight. I love my friends, sing it with me till the end. Oh my god, Carl got laid. These are the days that last a lifetime. Quit the drama and just have some fun. Memories are made with the best of friends, the true ones who have your back until the end

The cha cha bar was sliding ñ And we swam across the Scotchman on the rocks ñ (so many rocks . . . and glass and sand.) ñ In shock we docked in Fish Head Harbour ñ Where the lights were dimmed ñ (Locked in, we couldn't see a thing . . . ) ñ The floor was tin ñ The sky was oil ñ The air was poisoned lager ñ And the juke box pumped out schlager ñ Because no-one pulled the plugs ñ (so many plugs . . . and sparks.) ñ The live wives kept us dancing ñ Dance in brine, dance in seaweed
Dad, sister is on fire. shut up and get the marshmallows. dad, i don't like little brother. shut up and eat what i give you. let's go. this damn dollar has got to get me two. dad i'm tired of running in circles. shut up or i'll nail your other foot to the floor

I call the sky the day withdrew ñ Turning this fire we caught into ice with you ñ I can't leave this fever dream ñ I can't leave everything that I've seen ñ  ñ Oh Mary ñ I won't go ñ Oh Mary ñ Living mountain tide ñ  ñ The light embraced this tower the spark you drew ñ Forever chasing woe the sun imbued ñ One of these nights we'll return ñ Tripping over all the foolish things we thought we learned ñ  ñ Somebody held us there (x8)

The night is drawing near ñ The sky is black and clear ñ We waited ages ñ Now the stars are all aligned ñ Tonight the sky will glow ñ With Saturn and Scorpio ñ The preparations have been made ñ The rite may now begin ñ Figures in black robes ascend the mound ñ With magic symbols scratched into the ground ñ The text is read and makes an eerie sound ñ Whoa-oh oh ñ The sacrifice is placed upon the stone ñ The crooked dagger is plunged into flesh and bone ñ We see shadows twist and know we're not alone ñ Whoa-oh oh
Sometimes I float too far from the shore ñ Sometimes I forget who we are ñ I forget we're in love ñ Don't let me die alone ñ Don't let me die alone ñ Brought up to grovel and suffer ñ Complain and regret ñ Pour whiskey and let's drink to mother ñ For my heart's unrest ñ Don't let me die alone ñ Don't let me die alone
Let's take a car ñ And make a trip ñ Around the city ñ Let's have some fun ñ Let's mess around all night long ñ Just for fun, it's not a big deal ñ We'll drive around ñ And make a fuss ñ Around the city ñ Come on with us ñ We'll put the music loud on ñ With our song, so madly in love ñ We'll take a highway straight to the stars ñ To the end of the night ñ We'll break the speed of the sound ñ Break it to the beat of our hearts
Against the door I felt you there ñ Waiting for you ñ But this time I'm running scared ñ Sitting round here can't believe it happened ñ Phoenix fell before we tried ñ Disenchanting ñ What did you do to me ñ How could I not worry ñ What are you diving to now ñ Moving on side by side ñ Never aware ñ It's a lonely ship to ride unconcerned ñ Phoenix flies up to the sky ñ Her ashes ever fall ñ It's the same for you and I ñ What did I ever do ñ Shot by shot ñ What we go through ñ Where are you moving to tonight
The lyrics for this song have yet to be transcribed
One to another ñ We all hate each other ñ We're gonna drive that mother ñ Into the back of your spine ñ There's no protection ñ Against your evil reflection ñ The ultimate mirror of a ñ Two faced slime ñ Megalo megalomaniac ñ Egocentric animal ñ There's no turning back ñ Dig ñ Dig deep
Welcome to my love ñ I pray that you to be ñ And now at last you're here ñ So welcome to my love ñ And welcome to my heart ñ With every single beat ñ It hoped that we would meet ñ So welcome to my heart ñ Until there's love, my love ñ We merely exist ñ We walk, we move, we breathe ñ And then we kissed ñ And suddenly there's life ñ And every month is May ñ What else is there to say ñ But welcome to my love
Isn't it true to life ñ You don't know who you are ñ You're just some older tramp ñ Sympathy ain't gonna get you far ñ Isn't it true to life ñ You don't know where to go ñ You're just some north or south ñ Sympathy, ain't gonna take you low ñ Missing the train again ñ Time has slipped and passed you by ñ Missing the train again ñ Time has slipped and passed you by ñ Fading parts for bleeding hearts ñ Isn't it true, isn't it true to life? ñ Television has made you
You can't reveal ñ The future fades ñ The terror's near ñ The granite blades ñ Something wakes ñ Moves and shifts ñ The contacts made ñ The shot that lifts ñ How long ñ Can you survive ñ With a child of flames ñ How long ñ Can you survive ñ With a child of flames ñ Through each time ñ The thing still moves ñ The golden axe ñ The pounding hooves ñ You hear the sound ñ The naked shakes ñ Start to count ñ The balance breaks ñ How long ñ Can you survive ñ With a child of flames ñ How long ñ Can you survive ñ With a child of flames
You will hear in the distance ñ The children are whining ñ Oh how i cherish the thoughts ñ When the sun stops shining ñ The streets will grow silent ñ And they all go down ñ The grave how she burns ñ As i look into the ground ñ Forever in darkness away from rain ñ Forever in darkness to wear the chains ñ Scarlet beast shall rise ñ And takes a deep breath ñ There is no heart ñ Under her velvet chest ñ Oh how sweet is death ñ There's no more there's no less ñ But for those who deny ñ They run to the hills and hide
In Berlin ñ What do we do? ñ In November ñ In this weather ñ In this room ñ What do I sing? ñ Only for you ñ I'm such an outsider ñ But I'm so glad I met you ñ I was lonely in my own home ñ But I'm so glad I'm here with you ñ In Berlin ñ Where do we go? ñ In November ñ To December ñ In this world ñ What do you sing for? ñ Only for love ñ Only for love ñ Only for you
Southern trees bear a strange fruit ñ Blood on the leaves and blood at the root ñ Black bodies swinging in the Southern breeze ñ Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees ñ Pastoral scene of the gallant South ñ The bulging eyes and the twisted mouth ñ Scent of magnolias sweet and fresh ñ Then the sudden smell of burning flesh ñ Here is a fruit for the crows to pluck ñ For the rain to gather, for the wind to suck ñ For the sun to rot, for the tree to drop ñ Here is a strange and bitter crop
Hey, could have helped yourself ñ Just wind up and make it go ñ Hey, could have hurt yourself ñ Just wind up and make it go ñ I guess you ñ I guess you win ñ Could have helped yourself ñ I guess you ñ I guess you win ñ Could have helped yourself ñ Too bad it makes you so ñ Too bad it makes you so ñ Too bad it makes you so, lonely
Buried deep in the woods, nearing the swamp ñ There is a cave of hallucinogenic doom ñ Cauldrons of bubbling acid ñ You will start to trip just from the fumes ñ Cauldron, cauldron, cauldron, cauldron ñ Cave, cave, cave, cave ñ Cauldron, cauldron, cauldron, cauldron ñ Cauldron, cauldron, cauldron, cauldron ñ Cave, cave, cave, cave

Gonna find me a bluebird let him sing me a song ñ Cause my heart's been broken much too long ñ Gonna chase me a rainbow through a heaven of blue ñ Cause I'm all through crying over you ñ There was a time my love was needed ñ My life completed my dreams come true ñ Then came the time my life was haunted ñ My love unwanted all for you ñ There was a time...
You've got such a happy gaze like you walk around in a daze ñ Down inside you know that it's real ñ You want to shout it out loud that you got your head in a cloud? ñ Inside the natural way you know what I mean when I say ñ Do you love? ñ Do you love? ñ Do you love? ñ Do you love? ñ Do you love? ñ Do you love?
This is the last year of my life ñ Can't seem to do much more than I've done ñ Gone and used up all the fun ñ And the alternative is none ñ This is the first time I've realized ñ I loved believing all your lies ñ And didn't mind it when you cried ñ I plan on living just to die ñ This is the final year ñ I'm living out the very last year ñ The end is flashing on the screen ñ I'm living in the last year of my life
When you lay on on my bed ñ My whole body lose control ñ When you wake up close to me ñ I wanna stay whole life with you

Lyrics from Snippet ñ Niggas moving backwards in the streets, can't relate ñ Feeling like I'm Nipsey, I just hustle, motivate (Motivate) ñ We was on the back streets, running from the jakes ñ We had a shootout and robbery caught in the same tape
Ruthless blade of trespass, upon soft flesh of mind. in absence still remembered, you will return in time

Although they attempt to hide the events of the past ñ Their are no lies large enough to conceal or subtract ñ Indeed blood on the hands may quickly wash away ñ However the wound's inflicted are eternal, forever to stay ñ The Ghost of injustice spreads fear and provokes ñ A vicious malignant entity we have long since awoke ñ The choices are simple, remove the bandage and repair ñ Or continue to keep infected with more lie's and despair
You know what time it is... ñ You know what time it is... ñ You know what time it is... ñ Yeah! ñ Yeah! ñ You know what time it is... ñ You know what time it is... ñ Yeah!
We all follow ñ Loves long shadow ñ What will I do now? ñ How can I live without? ñ I'll never love again ñ Until I reach the end ñ  ñ We'll be together ñ Together again ñ We'll be together ñ Together again ñ  ñ She holds his hand ñ Says "You're my best friend" ñ But when she can't pretend ñ She starts to grow again ñ The dead are alive in us ñ Here in our universe ñ  ñ We'll be together ñ Together again ñ We'll be together ñ Together again ñ Together ñ Together again ñ We'll be together ñ Together again

If you loved me half as much as I love you ñ You wouldn't worry me half as much as you do ñ You're nice to me when there's no one else around ñ You only build me up to let me down ñ If you missed me half as much as I miss you ñ You wouldn't stay away half as much as you do ñ I know that I could never be this blue ñ If you only loved me half as much as I love you ñ I know that I could never be this blue ñ If you only loved me half as much as I love you

You're bound to fall for the bugle call; ñ You're gonna brag 'bout the Bugle Call Rag ñ Thin or fat, young or old; ñ Shake their shoulders bold ñ You're bound to fall for the bugle call; ñ You're gonna brag 'bout the Bugle Call Rag ñ Hold me baby; Let's syncopate to that blue melody; ñ Just hesitate while a break they take Shh! ñ While we're dancing please hold me tight; step lively don't lag
It's the most wonderful time of the year ñ With the kids jingle belling ñ And everyone telling you ñ "Be of good cheer," ñ It's the most wonderful time of the year ñ There'll be parties for hosting ñ Marshmallows for toasting and ñ Caroling out in the snow ñ There'll be scary ghost stories and ñ Tales of the glories of Christmases ñ Long, long ago ñ It's the most wonderful time of the year ñ There'll be much mistletoeing ñ And hearts will be glowing ñ When loved ones are near ñ It's the most wonderful time of the year

Sensitivity levels, confusion limits ñ The density of unresolved ideas ñ In the field of view, energy emits ñ A fluxus level ride of evolution ñ Rethinking strategies ñ Terror forms in liquid slums ñ Dictators' ships supplied at all costs ñ Sulphur spots and rising tides ñ Fetid chancellors of taste ñ Lowest counts since moonman walked on all fours ñ Understanding formation and evolution ñ Starburst galaxies and population ñ Energy budgets of luminosity ñ Occurring daily to gauge determination
Beautiful Savior, King of Creation ñ Son of God and Son of Man ñ You will we cherish, You will we honor ñ Light of our souls, their joy, and crown ñ Fair are the meadows, fair are the woodlands ñ Robed in flowers of blooming spring ñ Jesus is fairer, Jesus is purer ñ He makes our sorrowing spirit sing ñ Fair is the sunshine, fair is the moonlight ñ Bright the sparkling stars on high ñ Jesus shines brighter, Jesus shines purer ñ Than all the angels in the sky
The only reason for my worship ñ Is you, my Jesus ñ The only reason to live ñ Is you, my Lord ñ My only truth is in you ñ You are my light and my salvation ñ My only love is you, Lord ñ And I will always praise you ñ Chorus: ñ You are all-powerful ñ You are great and majestic ñ You are strong, invincible ñ And there is no one like you

Sarah sitting in her house ñ Painting each nail like it's a watercolor ñ All day, I sit here waiting ñ For my fastidious flower ñ Look here at her table ñ Her life is filled with perfect pictures ñ Reds and blues ñ In the upstairs room ñ But I'm far too shy to try them too ñ Tossed and turned all night long ñ And in the morning my mind's as good as gone ñ She is filling up my head with song ñ But she won't tell the words ñ So I can't sing along
At last ñ My love has come along ñ My lonely days are over ñ And love is like a song (Oh, yeah) ñ At last ñ The skies above are blue ñ My heart was wrapped up in clovers ñ The night I looked at you ñ I found a dream that I can speak to ñ A dream that I can call my own ñ I found a thrill to press my cheek to ñ A thrill that I have never known (Oh, yeah) ñ You smiled, you smiled ñ And then the spell was cast ñ And here we are in heaven ñ For you are mine at last ñ At last
Small room ñ Room with no view ñ Confusion in my mind ñ Is it really me or you? ñ Out of reach and out of sight ñ Solitary confinement for peace of mind ñ With a cyclop's eye through the peephole in the door ñ Now they kick and they curse me and they get me on the floor ñ The locks engage ñ I don't even have the luxury of rage ñ Feeling far removed i view this situation ñ Nakedness a new degradation ñ They stare through a judas hole ñ But they can't see into the depths of my soul ñ Depths of my soul
I got a letter this morning, my baby's gone away ñ I received a letter, my baby's gone away ñ I felt so good, just like a baby boy ñ I'll be a brand new man when my baby arrive at home ñ I won't be trouble no more ñ I feel so good (So good) ñ I broke down and cried, oh, yeah ñ  ñ Yes, yes, nobody knows what I been through ñ  ñ I pray both night and day ñ I pray for someone to love
Yes... hot... ñ And everybody workin' on it ñ So I figured I'd rip off her ñ Her drawers and get a little ñ We'll be back in a little while

Here I go again ñ Better off this way for now ñ So let go ñ And here I go again ñ Better off this for way for now ñ So let go ñ  ñ Hey dragging me that way ñ Breathe ñ I can't feel your eyes upon my skin ñ Hey ñ Begging me to stay here ñ But I can't stop the rain from coming in ñ No, I can't stop the rain from coming in
All the people I have savaged ñ Held in my mouth ñ Shook 'em out ñ They rattle behind me ñ As I enter the room ñ Such jagged music ñ Like tin cans ñ On a honeymoon

Embrace from a letter will raise all the dead. You're light as a feather and stiff in the head. Brainchilds opus will remain exiled, Open the gates. We are just lying by the waste, helping this pointless suffering...

From a DC-9 at night ñ I look out on a field of lights ñ But that's not for you and I, I know ñ Pools of darkness lie ñ Both to the left and right ñ Beneath the swollen sky ñ The low lows ñ On a DC-9 in flight ñ They turn the aisle lights off at midnight ñ I saw a bright and shining sidewalk through the clouds ñ Slowly diverging from our route ñ & pressed my hand against ñ The tiny row of plastic windows ñ And watched the next-to-last hope go ñ The low lows ñ The low lows ñ The low lows

I've got no one ñ No place to go ñ One man travelin' freak show ñ Riding the flatlands, etc ñ Nuclear wasteland is my home ñ Sun-baked desert all to my own- ñ I've been many places ñ Not a lot to see ñ Civilisation is now history
I would be ignorant as the dawn ñ That has looked down ñ On that old queen measuring a town ñ With the pin of a brooch, ñ Or on the withered men that saw ñ From their pedantic Babylon ñ The careless planets in their courses, ñ The stars fade out where the moon comes, ñ And took their tablets and did sums; ñ I would be ignorant as the dawn ñ That merely stood, rocking the glittering coach ñ Above the cloudy shoulders of the horses; ñ I would be--for no knowledge is worth a straw-- ñ Ignorant and wanton as the dawn.

As I journey through this blessed land ñ The signs and wonders are clear to me ñ Streams of silver ñ Streams of gold How much longer will they flow ñ Will they flow ñ Watch the seasons change with every year ñ With disappearing skies the earth will fade ñ Trees so tall and proud ñ Forests so grand ñ How much longer will they stand ñ Will they stand ñ Raindrops falling ñ Everything breathes ñ Hear the voices of the land
There's an old road ñ Where I like to walk and dream ñ About strangers come ñ And strangers go after all ñ There will be roses all around you ñ There will be roses on the view ñ There will be roses in those old rooms ñ There will be roses to be true

You're the one ñ That they've said ñ Has drifted towards the sun ñ Touched the surface and said ñ "I'm not the only one" ñ I was bored ñ So were you ñ The drama made was fun ñ Years they've past ñ And we grew ñ Too far from times once loved ñ If all is lost ñ All is lost ñ As tears run down your cheeks ñ As you fill ñ Up your life ñ With men whose souls are weak ñ I don't care anymore ñ The loss has turned to hate ñ As I live Out my days ñ Blessed by the best mistake
In another place ñ Another sense of time ñ Creation in my eyes ñ Slip as tethers fade ñ Tune a frequency and glide ñ Beyond this mortal fire ñ Other single states ñ Left drifting in the wake ñ Still a unity of one ñ Stepping back to view ñ A frame extending on all sides ñ Creation in my eyes ñ We are too young ñ Too innocent to see what is right before our eyes ñ Nothing before, nothing will end ñ We never truly die ñ Like a spark of energy cries for life and ignites ñ One day we'll realize ñ That all worlds must collide
Blue, blue, my world is blue ñ Blue is my world now I'm without you ñ Gray, gray, my life is gray ñ Cold is my heart since you went away ñ Red, red, my eyes are red ñ Crying for you alone in my bed ñ Green, green, my jealous heart ñ I doubted you and now we're apart ñ When we met how the bright sun shone ñ Then love died, now the rainbow is gone ñ Black, black, the nights I've known ñ Longing for you so lost and alone
Every night you'll hear her croon ñ A Russian lullaby ñ Just a little plaintive tune ñ When baby starts to cry ñ Rock-a-bye my baby ñ Somewhere there may be ñ A land that's free for you and me ñ And a Russian lullaby ñ Rock-a-bye my baby ñ Somewhere there may be ñ A land that's free for you and me ñ And a Russian ñ A Russian ñ Russian lullaby ñ Russian lullaby
Stars fall out ñ Of the sky, my love ñ One by one ñ As the years go by ñ And one by one ñ All the ghosts in the night ñ Whisper my name ñ And fly away ñ I don't wait for their return ñ I don't wait for their return ñ Across the miles ñ The golden flood ñ Reaches far into the night ñ In the dust of end ñ Highway song ñ I whisper your name ñ And fly away ñ I will wait for your return ñ I will wait for your return ñ I will wait for your return ñ I will wait for your return
Done with bending ñ Reachin' around ñ Pieces of this town ñ Spy street corner ñ Wish you were there ñ A ticket looked at me (for a while) ñ Faces every hour ñ One named Lewellyn ñ But wasn't mine at all ñ I could reach you ñ But I don't have the will to go on ñ Rain party ñ Wish you were there ñ Smiles along with loss ñ Wearing a vest of charlatan dust ñ Come down and stay ñ And be right ñ Names at our disposal ñ One named Lewellyn ñ And then my cards fall ñ I could reach you ñ But I don't have the will to go on
I know, I know we're lost ñ I know, I know we're lost ñ I can't help myself when we drive ñ Oh, don't hold us back, this midnight drive ñ  ñ You see the stars are out tonight ñ You see the stars are out tonight ñ  ñ I know, I know we're lost ñ I know, I know we're lost ñ I can't help myself when we drive ñ Oh, don't hold us back, this midnight drive ñ  ñ You see the stars are out tonight ñ You see the stars are out tonight
Nost I'm the Glory ñ The symbol of Lory ñ Bring me the crystal ñ Univerce i'm your lord now ñ Panthers around my throne ñ My daughter's blood ñ My palace appear ñ Mephesis of black crystal ñ Carry the charriot ñ I ride tilveria ñ The crystal in the right side ñ Winged plasma ñ You will never arise ñ Clean as the water ñ You'll see into my soul ñ The rings in my fingers ñ Each word each order ñ You'll never smell the flowers again ñ You'll never see the ocean ñ The crystallic orizon ñ I paint all the walls in black

You don't wanna wage anything on me ñ If you believe you're just gambling ñ Build a fire and see if I die ñ Build a fire and wait till I die ñ When you are afraid, where to will you run? ñ Cash in all your coins and just forget you love me ñ Build a fire and see if I die ñ Build a fire and wait till I die
The number of men who carried the flame continued to increase ñ And a massive force was gathered just outside the prison ñ Where the evil one had trapped the souls of men ñ And with a sounding trumpet ñ In an instant the siege was underway ñ The forces of humanity swarmed the enemy camp ñ They stormed the gates relentlessly ñ Waving their torches and shouting together ñ There is none that can stand against the power of fire
I don't know if I care any more ñ The silver's hidden under the floor ñ It's been there since the Civil War ñ Oh I'll be out by 1934 ñ Agree when they say yes ñ Never differ when they say no ñ It's only my lowest guess ñ That I'll be out by 1934 ñ My mother's never been the same ñ My father's a forgotten name ñ Don'T you both know what for? ñ I'll be out by 1934 ñ Oh I'll be out by 1934
Grab your cap, grab your looners ñ Let's go!
The world is so cold and merciless ñ I see it as a reminder of myself ñ The cold lifeless fluid flowing through my body ñ I see it in me ñ Numbs my feeling leaves me with no remorse ñ For what I have done to myself and to others ñ Looking into bloodstained mirrors with no reflection ñ Nothing to dwell on but the thought of causing more pain to others ñ Just like this cold world ñ Why am I this fucking cold? ñ Take me out ñ Burn me now so that I can feel ñ No hope for me ñ Burn me now ñ No hope for me
Do not be afraid
Strange angels, why do you treat me so mean? ñ You look strange angel ñ Now why do you treat me so mean? ñ You're the meanest little girl that I most ever seen ñ You left me this morning and didn't even say goodbye ñ Yes, you left me this morning ñ And didn't even say goodbye ñ I wanna love you, baby, but I don't know the reason why ñ Ah, when I said goodbye, baby, I didn't mean for you to go ñ When I said goodbye, baby, I didn't mean for you to go ñ You get devilin' on your mind ñ And I ain't never see you anymore
I go humble ñ You're so curiously pure ñ Only before you I'm humble ñ  ñ I go humble ñ You amaze me ñ Only before you I'm humble ñ  ñ I should be arrested ñ For my emotional stunts ñ Only before you I'm humble ñ  ñ I'm queen of provocation ñ I wake people up ñ Only before you I'm humble ñ  ñ I go humble ñ I adore you ñ Only before you I'm humble ñ  ñ I should be arrested ñ For my emotional stunts ñ Only before you I'm humble
Sam Jones done snagged his britches ñ Now he's walkin' round here in stitches ñ He always pal'ed 'round with his vipers ñ 'Til they brought him down to his diapers ñ Hmm!

You sold your life ñ In a discount store ñ You watch TV ñ You don't want any more ñ Oh, I tried to warn you ñ Oh, I could not stop you ñ Oh ñ You got ideas ñ In your head ñ They won't happen ñ You're the living dead ñ Oh, I tried to warn you ñ Oh, I could not stop you ñ Oh
Adventitious roots ñ From its stems elongate ñ Digging deeper, taking hold ñ Provenances random grip in depth ñ Through the soil below ñ Profoundly to the underworld ñ Anchoring the spread of the flowering mass above ñ The mass ñ Symbolic of the growing green ñ The green that will overtake the world ñ Asterales ñ Spherical leaves overflowing ñ Wave upon wave of stringed beads ñ Jewels of wintry white ñ In wafting cascades
Looking out of my window ñ Breathing a sigh of relief ñ Already my mind is taking detailed account ñ Of everything I see ñ I'm trying harder to fight ñ Stuck in the mud, the smell of the weapons burned ñ Reaches a high ñ I'm screaming as loud as they'll let me ñ God knows I won't let them die ñ They're fighting in the woods ñ They're hiding in the trees ñ I was praying all I could ñ They're fighting in the woods ñ They're hiding in the trees ñ I was praying all I could

When I get to my God in heaven ñ I will tell him how you treated me ñ You people of the world ñ I will tell him how you treated me ñ If you treat me with love and kindness ñ I will tell him to send you up to heaven ñ Heaven, the best place for comfort ñ When you see a good thing in this world ñ And you try to change it to bad ñ When you see a white thing in this world ñ And you try to say he's black ñ If you treat me the way you treated Jesus ñ I will beg God to send you off to hell ñ Hell, will suffer you forever

Write me a letter a face in the hall ñ Hiding from someone afraid of the fall ñ And she's waiting for someone to take her back to where she came from ñ And she'll wait alone for hours she won't mind because there's someone ñ In the story she remembers she remembers in the letter ñ And the tears locked up inside her make her heart break open wider ñ Shuts her eyes and takes the picture from the wall
Leaves are green are turning brown ñ This silent world keeps turning round ñ The simple charm that your beneath ñ Seems as far as he can be ñ All I say is show me the way to be as good as this day ñ Sweet songs blended together it's a remorse for stormy weather ñ The hand that reaches to my face cloaked in silver and in lace ñ And all I want is the chance to be a spirit and to be as good as this day

My fate is a haunted curse ñ Please! I'm just a human being ñ Effort doesn't press onto me ñ Please, make this a real world
Rang her up and her father said she's gone ñ You're too late boy ñ She's already been taken ñ Rang again, what her father said was wrong ñ It's not true boy ñ Daddy was mistaken ñ What am I to do about it ñ What am I to do about this thing ñ There's no way I can feel about it ñ 'Cause I don't even know how much I love her ñ I consider you so expendable ñ You might as well pack your bags and go ñ I don't need you ñ My whole world revolves around me ñ Inflate my ego

Impossible, you do all the things I told you not to do ñ Staying in the rain and staying after school ñ No one ever gives a second look at you ñ  ñ I cannot believe the message fled his son ñ Moving out you'd think that they'd be havin' so much fun ñ I cannot believe that they are still 21 ñ {Outro} ñ No one goes to college anymore ñ No one goes to college anymore
I can't help about the shape I'm in ñ I can't sing, I ain't pretty and my legs are thin ñ But don't ask me what I think of you ñ I might not give the answer that you want me to ñ Oh well ñ And when I talk to God I know he'll understand ñ He says, "Stick by me, I'll be your guiding hand ñ But don't ask me what I think of you ñ I might not give the answer that you want me to" ñ Oh well
Take me, feel me, hold me tonight ñ Feel me, love me, take me home ñ Hold me, touch me, feel me ñ Take me, feel me, love me tonight ñ Take me, feel me, hold me tonight ñ Take me, hold me, love me tonight

It took a thousand years ñ To find you ñ Our paths crossed on this fateful night ñ Under a dark sky ñ We both kept a secret ñ That we tried to hide ñ But soon, we opened our souls ñ And realized that we are one of a kind ñ  ñ We're living in a world of dreams ñ Far away from reality ñ Now, we've reached the point of no return ñ We have to find a way ñ We have to escape from this place ñ Where we don't belong ñ They will try to find us ñ They will try to catch our souls ñ But they will never get us ñ When we turn into stardust
Humanity - the evil in you and me we drench ourselves in misery sold our souls to dollar signs ñ We let our greed control our lives it's pain to see that we're bleeding ourselves dry ñ Over and over and over again we're always running with nowhere to go and the years they'll pass us by without a thing to show smiles on our faces but our hearts have grown cold

You can't forget the time you fell into her trap ñ You can't forget the time you fell into the web ñ Some might fear another call of your regret ñ And after all it's wonderful how she broke your wall ñ So much for your freedom ñ So much for your thoughts ñ So much for your feelings ñ So much after all........

Hold me now or ever hold your peace ñ In sickness and in health, there's a wealth in staying true ñ Who's the water to your fire? ñ Who's the earth to your air? ñ How can you be without some symmetry? ñ Hold me now or ever hold your peace ñ When the honeymoon is over ñ It takes more than a friend to make it to the end
After supper I will go out for a walk ñ I'll wander through the woods near the family house ñ I'll speak to the trees and they'll speak to me ñ ( It took me some times before I understand ) ñ Sitting on the bank of the river where I was born ñ I throw stones away, waiting for the storm ñ ( I know It's coming soon when It's silent in the woods ) ñ Will we stay here forever? ñ Will we live over and over? ñ Will the wind wash our minds off the filthy thoughts we had sometimes?
Implications running rampant ñ Mayhem in the streets ñ They've blocked off all the boundaries ñ Armed themselves to the teeth ñ Back up reinforcements ñ Line the route at every turn ñ Riot gear close at hand ñ To defend the fatherland ñ Display of force, display of power ñ Show your civic pride ñ Your shirt is pressed ñ Your shoes are shined ñ For the square mile ride ñ The troops proceed ñ The band plays on ñ The children march in step ñ Floats, clowns, balloons and bubble gum ñ This is the best parade yet
On the floating, shapeless oceans ñ I did all my best to smile ñ Til your singing eyes and fingers ñ Drew me loving into your eyes ñ Here I am, here I am waiting to hold you ñ Here I am, here I am waiting to hold you ñ Here I am, here I am waiting to hold you ñ Here I am, here I am waiting to hold you

You know when it gets too hot to touch ñ We think you've had enough ñ It makes me feel like I don't need ñ To make my body bleed ñ Would you stop hitting so hard? ñ Hitting so hard ñ Hitting so hard ñ Hitting so hard ñ I swung until I broke my hand ñ Then I got mad again ñ You said it makes you want to die ñ But that still feels alright ñ I won't stop hitting so hard ñ Hitting so hard ñ Hitting so hard ñ Hitting so hard
Lifeforce's getting sucked out like our blood ñ Vampires taking everything we've got ñ They want us to live our lifes in fear ñ They want us to build a perfect gear ñ  ñ Vampires on our soul ñ  ñ We want it, we need it ñ We need revolt on holy ground ñ Like thunder & lightning ñ No chains or boundaries hold us down ñ Playing games with lies and thoughts control ñ Synchronicity their highest goal ñ They transgress the boundaries of good taste ñ Take a stand now, no more time to waste
Lyrics from snippet: ñ Go ñ In the pitch black, girl, you're my baby ñ Here we go, here we go ñ Here we go, here we go
Capitalist wanker - neat idea ñ Increase profits, sell more beer ñ Company announce music sponsorship ñ Just a cheap ad for their f**kin' shit ñ Tennents Live - parasites ñ Tennents Live - F**k you ñ You can't buy our energy, you can't buy our anger ñ We're not the puppets of some big business wanker ñ So greedhead, you're out of luck ñ We're not for sale and you can get tae f**k
Pack up all my care and woe ñ Here I go, singing low ñ Bye bye blackbird ñ Where somebody waits for me ñ Sugar's sweet, so is she ñ Bye bye blackbird ñ No one here can love and understand me ñ Oh what hardluck stories they all hand me ñ Make my bed and light the light ñ I'll arrive late tonight ñ Blackbird, bye bye ñ No one here can love and understand me ñ Oh what hardluck stories they all hand me ñ Make my bed and light the light ñ I'll arrive late tonight ñ Blackbird, bye bye
I bleed for you, amber star ñ At the gates of dawn ñ I will bleed again until pale death ñ Takes me into its hands ñ And I am left on my own ñ The moon bleeds with me ñ None has what one wants ñ The sun never crowned the night ñ With the richness of its colours... ñ The passionate play of your fingers ñ They stir the waters we once knew ñ And the sun is too late again ñ To see me disappear in the rain ñ We all seek something ñ I never sought anything but this
Can't seem to get this ñ Through your head ñ A thousand fuck you's ñ Never said ñ Just what I need to say to you ñ I see the rats ñ Turning all the screws ñ You and I ñ Let it die ñ Come clean fade away ñ I'll tell you now ñ Afraid to bleed this? ñ I'll show you how
Acquiesce to truly have an aesthesis ñ Being true to you is always thrills ñ Reality's become a trauma artist ñ I'm choosing now to not hate-watch ñ Regrets want to stage lives ñ Now that i've vowed to save you from this awful place ñ Our ears burn at the sound of my name ñ 'cause when they look at me babe ñ I know what they see ñ I know how they see me

When the days had grown shortest, and the leaves all died ñ When life became scarce ñ And all was covered in ice ñ There lived a pack of wolves against every odd ñ That grew hungry and tired and needed to hunt ñ They'd sneak into the towns in the dead of the night ñ And seek fire for comfort and warmth in the light ñ And though they weren't evil, and knew it was wrong ñ They couldn't escape the lust for the blood

If I take the medication. If I lose my hair. If the slightest hesitation takes me anywhere, let it pour. Let it be forgotten ñ If you dare to wish me well and I disappear. If your reckless second-guesses drive me out of here, let me pour. Let me be forgotten ñ Crawl through the gaps in the curtains. Howl through the night. Sail down the hallway out of sight ñ If I offer up my body. If I dare to lose. I can take the shape of anything they want me to
All these years I've stayed faithful ñ Through bitterness I've bled ñ Sacrifice, betrayal and deceit, has rid me of the weak ñ Tragedy of the faithful, dying for a lost cause ñ Tragedy of the faithful, loyalty unto death ñ At the mercy of the vengeful ñ Mislead and betrayed ñ Through darkness and misery ñ I've walked the bloodstained path ñ Tragedy of the faithful ñ So many has fallen ñ Tragedy of the faithful ñ Loyalty unto death
Fooled by your fallaciousness ñ And your ingenuous mind ñ Inflatable thoughts bursting ñ By just one touch ñ Left in a dream ñ With your growing shit ñ Greed, covetousness ñ All that's in your filthy mind ñ Your corporation ñ My suffocation ñ Left in a dream ñ With your growing shit
High tales, and low tales, love has no part in ñ Story upon story, would you marry me? ñ 23 lies you told, many more lives you hold ñ Thought I could believe, thought I could believe ñ How long can you play this? How long can you last? ñ Gaze up, you're so restless, on your way down fast ñ 23 lies you told, many more lives you hold ñ 23 lies you told, many more lives you hold ñ Thought I could believe

Help me live a life ñ Of love that pleases ñ My one desire ñ Is to see You lifted ñ To see You lifted ñ To see You lifted ñ Burn me up, Burn me up ñ Until all that's seen ñ All that's seen is You ñ Jesus You're all ñ I've ever needed ñ Your joy will be ñ The strength I live by ñ The strength I live by ñ The strength I live by ñ Lead me on to the place ñ Where I'll see You face to face ñ Where Your glory is revealed ñ Lead me on ñ Lead me on
She was too good to me ñ How can I get along now ñ So close she stood to me ñ Everything seems all wrong now ñ She would have brought me the sun ñ Making me smile ñ That was her fun ñ When I was mean to her ñ She never said 'go away now' ñ I was a king to her ñ Who's gonna make me gay now ñ It's only natural ñ I'm so blue ñ She was too good to be true ñ When I was mean to her ñ She never said 'go away now' ñ I was a king to her ñ Who's gonna make me gay now ñ It's only natural ñ I'm so blue ñ She was too good to be true

Don't be a baby, Baby ñ By the love that pass you by ñ But if you have to, Baby ñ Go ahead and have your cry ñ I'll be your baby, Baby ñ Truer than the one you knew ñ And someday maybe, Baby ñ You will learn to love me too
 You repulse me ñ  I am beautiful ñ  I hate you ñ  I love you ñ  How can you even love yourself? ñ  I am worthy ñ  You disgust me ñ  I am pure ñ  I'm letting you go now ñ  Please don't go ñ  You'll burn in Hell ñ  I will float to mortality ñ  There is no God ñ  God is inside of me ñ  No wonder your father left you ñ  He should have protected me ñ  Just take your clothes off ñ  I will not ñ  You're a whore ñ  I forgive you
Burning throughout the wedding - it's confirming, I'm contained ñ I'm more my bride's shadow than a groom is meant to be ñ But the bells sing "you're no liar." ñ As she bares a half-man's fire
I said the final prayer too late ñ Approach those firey gates ñ Condemned to eternal wait ñ I paid my weight in silver and gold ñ And asked for it in writing ñ She looked at me with fearful eyes and said ñ ...and then I saw the blood coming ñ The gates of hell open for me ñ And as far as my eyes could see ñ In carnage ñ Your demise
I come before you ñ At this time to make ñ An expression of grattitude ñ Not only for myself ñ But for my loved ones... ñ And for all the people here ñ On Mother Earth say to always be peace ñ So we can enjoy life and look forward to a life ñ Of happiness and eternity ñ This is your promise to us ñ Let us all honor it ñ All through the time meditate ñ Hey!
Lyrics from Snippet ñ  ñ Is it the same? ñ Does she sit with you in the rain? ñ Does she kiss your body all over again and again?
Lyrics from Snippet ñ  ñ  hoe ass nigga in the met ñ Niggas keep talkin' that U.K. shit like I don't got AKs ñ Like, 'cause I was born overseas, these muhfuckers ain't gon' spray-spray ñ Pull up in your hood, nigga, 9-1-1, y'all better call mayday ñ From Glenwood all the way to Martin Luther King, niggas know we don't play-play
Rico! ñ Woah, Kenny! ñ Haha ñ I beat the system ñ And I ain't have to cheat the system ñ You can get it on and on by talkin bout the wisdom ñ The rims and windows, they black and the top be missin ñ I don't be up in the mix, bitch I'm the mixin ñ And I'm the miss's ñ Got balls like I'm the mister ñ I seen the picture ñ Not trippin over bad decision ñ I grab the pistol ñ The 5-6 isn't an issue ñ And if it is, it ain't nothing for the boys to get you
I'm not here, there's no bright light ñ Sounds like fear in your white nights ñ I see you through your skin ñ Stay close, let me think ñ Now open, fill me in ñ Say my name, let me in ñ Come to me, take my hand ñ To the exit, to the end ñ Come to me, take my hand ñ To the exit, to the end
Cast into the lake of fire ñ Gagged by blood ñ A thousand deaths unwind ñ Storming ñ Perseverance is none ñ Repenting not ñ Mass decay of life ñ Swarming ñ Call upon ñ Call on those we scorn ñ Raze their faith and feeble ways ñ Mute the son ñ Deliverance bygone ñ Mute the mouth of empty praise ñ Trapped inside a burning field ñ Sheep of god ñ Followers who did not heed ñ The warning ñ Unblessing of the purity ñ Once the norm ñ Darkness holds the blasphemy ñ Swarming ñ Insanity will reign supreme ñ Azazel ñ Belial ñ Abaddon ñ Leviathan
I've been tired before, but never like this ñ What's happened to me, what's happened to me ñ Are you talking to me, cause talking is cheap ñ Can you imagine to feel like you'll die young ñ I've been changing my mood, I'd thought I'd be cool ñ Inviting me in, as it starts to begin ñ Or has it already started, did it start when we parted ñ Is it always difficult, the second time around
Forget the nights of Revelation ñ Now it's time, sweet sensation ñ Indulge in this wild libido ñ LSD floods your veins ñ  ñ Acid orgy ñ Acid orgy ñ Acid orgy ñ Join the acid orgy ñ Inner thoughts of sexual lust ñ A trip beyond all reality ñ Intertwined throbbing mass ñ Sweating flesh comes together ñ  ñ Intravenous, pollution of blood ñ Hallucinations fill your vision ñ Voyeur in you has come forward ñ Drink the blood of your partner
Lost my partner, what'll I do ñ Lost my partner, what'll I do ñ Lost my partner, what'll I do ñ Skip to my Lou my darling ñ Gone again, skip to my Lou ñ Skip to my Lou my darling ñ I'll get another one, prettier 'n new ñ Skip to my Lou my darling ñ Little red wagon painted blue ñ Skip to my Lou my darling ñ Flies in the buttermilk, two by two ñ Skip to my Lou my darling ñ Flies in the sugar bowl, shou shou shou ñ Skip to my Lou my darling ñ Lots more verses but there's a lotta do ñ Skip to my Lou my darling
We're only here for so long ñ So short so hold on ñ Blink my eyes now I'm gone ñ Time it never stops ñ The look in your face says what's wrong ñ You don't gotta say a word, darling ñ I'm getting good at reading body, language if it's yours ñ Plants sprouting in the garden ñ Stand with you till hell has fallen ñ Go to sleep I'll keep you guarded ñ You are safe tonight ñ Truth of the matter is I'll never leave ñ You just wait and see ñ I'll never leave ñ You just wait and see ñ I'll never leave ñ You just wait and see
I see a world destined to fall beneath me ñ The world, the sky, designed to leave it behind ñ I shall not kneel ñ I declare non serviam ñ Forever enslaved by one law ñ Forever cast down all dissension ñ Raise the flag on shattered lands ñ Conceal the truth with bloodstained hands ñ I shall not kneel ñ I declare non serviam
I broke up when you left for the night ñ And I swear that I wanted to die ñ When the dust from the smoke filled my eyes ñ So I started my own fire
Every litle whisper every little sound ñ Brings me comfort whenever you're around ñ A heart full of wonder and sweet reverie ñ Gives me a reason a reason to believe ñ  ñ Forever's just begun ñ We'll never turn and run ñ Slowly we've become ñ One, one ñ Slowly we've become one ñ  ñ I love the way we're different ñ And the way we're the same ñ Making love to each other ñ Is like shelter from the rain ñ Isn't it amazing ñ What I see in your eyes ñ I'll be your partner ñ And never leave your side

Marching ñ To the sound of silence ñ Doubting ñ What we hope to find there ñ Walking ñ To forget the future ñ Denying ñ That we all are dying ñ Where no one sleeps ñ Time will turn ñ Regrets that burn
Deeper than the usual feeling
Sad is to live in solitude ñ Far from your tranquil altitude ñ Sad is to know that no one ever can live on a dream ñ That never can be, will never be ñ Dreamer awake, wake up and see ñ Your beauty is an aeroplane ñ So high my heart can't bear the strain ñ A heart that stops when you pass by ñ Only to cause me pain ñ Sad is to live in solitude ñ Your beauty is an aeroplane ñ So high my heart can't bear the strain ñ A heart that stops when you pass by ñ Only to cause me pain ñ Sad is to live in solitude

Up for days cutting losses and trading in the most precious of wings ñ The nights never end, and these ghosts will never know true rest ñ They stretch for miles, they take me home ñ In the name of love and you I say... ñ Sometimes when you win the war you lose it all ñ Towering, they stretch for miles ñ Speaking as eloquently as the tallest of tales ñ They stretch for miles ñ They take me home
I hear, you're waving me off ñ I hear, you're moving on past ñ I hear, you're sending me on ñ At last ñ I hear, your time has come ñ I hope your time will last ñ And on and on and on and on ñ At last, at last ñ Though I confront you ñ I want you better start ñ This time I won't let it be ñ Start ñ One thin time, won't let it start ñ How much longer will it start? ñ There it is again ñ I hear your time has come ñ I hope you timed it last ñ And on and on and on and on ñ At last, at last
She dreamed the doctors arrived ñ And severed her legs at the knee. ñ This she dreamed on a morning ñ Of a night she slept beside me. ñ Now I was not in this dream ñ Or the cry of the amputee, ñ Yet she told me this on a morning ñ Of a night she slept beside me.
Well, somebody knocking on my door ñ Well, somebody knocking on my door ñ Well, I'm so worried, don't know where to go ñ  ñ Well, somebody calling me, calling on my telephone ñ Well, somebody calling me, over my telephone ñ Well, keep on calling, tell them I'm not at home ñ Well, don't not worry, Daddy has gone to bed

Seems like falling down ñ Or away lost at sea ñ Or the one that's left behind ñ Or the wake of you and me ñ  ñ Maybe I know that ñ Maybe it's better ñ But I can't forget the time ñ  ñ I know where I am ñ Every day every night ñ Like the one who knows too much ñ Trusts the same old thing ñ  ñ Maybe I know that ñ Maybe it's better ñ But I can't forget the time ñ  ñ Realizing nothing ñ I remember when ñ  ñ Maybe I know that ñ Maybe it's better ñ But I can't forget the time ñ Maybe I know that ñ Maybe it's better ñ But I can't forget the time
Step from your body and run ñ Everything you have become ñ Everything you were before ñ Anything you're dreaming of ñ Stand at the edge and delay ñ Something that made you this way ñ Something that caused you to part ñ All things must come here to last ñ In lunar light I was there ñ Watching the world spin again ñ Watching myself fade away ñ And leaving myself for a moment
We wish you a merry Christmas ñ We wish you a merry Christmas ñ We wish you a merry Christmas ñ And a happy New Year ñ Good tidings we bring to you and your kin ñ We wish you a merry Christmas and a happy New Year ñ Now bring us some Jagermeister ñ Now bring us some (??) ñ Now bring us some Southern Comfort ñ And band that's fucked up ñ We wish you a merry Christmas ñ We wish you a merry Christmas ñ We wish you a merry Christmas ñ And a happy New Year ñ Mazel tov

Open your eyes ñ It's only just begun ñ All hold hands ñ Let the will be done ñ Dawn is on its feet again ñ They're stabbing into the street again ñ But the loneliest ones ñ Take a stab at the sun ñ Standing together my friends and me ñ Thirty-Three on the balcony ñ A single file line of losers makes for a winning streak ñ In taking ourselves did we take a vote ñ Stu from Appliances wrote the note ñ We look down below us at the people and cars ñ Funny how little they look and how big we now are

Thursday was a good day. He'd be turning up at nine, he'd be turning ñ Down the lights, he'd be breaking out the wine. Made it whoopee on the ñ Settee, shared a candle, split a line. Made it happy in the ñ Chandeliers. Mind-mind-mind-link. I think we really could get on ñ Together. Mind-mind-mind-link. My planetary choo-choo girl, you got me ñ In a superwhirl. I'd climb out to the Milky Way. Mind-mind-mind-link ñ Take it away brothers

There was something strange ñ In my sensations ñ Incredibly new and incredibly sweet ñ I knew myself to be tenfold more evil ñ This intoxicated me like wine ñ Here was a realm you have never known ñ You will be transported to paradise ñ The transformation begins ñ The chemistry of love ñ The vapours of hate ñ Soul turned inside out ñ The alchemistry of sex ñ The apparatus of blood ñ We have no more solid core ñ Lycanthropy unfolds ñ Dark Aegis ñ New boundaries broken
They have no more power ñ They have no room to deflower ñ To end the fear, to end this pain ñ We must cleanse this earth with the sulphur and rain ñ Still you're all waiting for perdition's son ñ Who needs your fucking god when I've got my gun? ñ Forget flesh harvest ñ That which brings us to our knees will separate our fantasies
Sailing under a false flag ñ We're crossing the IDL ñ Becalmed where no creature lives ñ Lost, forsaken, cursed ñ Holed below the water line ñ A shift in the plimsoll line ñ Pumps in the engine room ñ Women and children first ñ Hysterical, no humour ñ Sabotage, a rumour ñ Captainless and captionless ñ Injury, hunger, thirst ñ Reptile, prehensile ñ Servile, editorial ñ Gentile, fatal
She's gotta work it for the pleasure of the people... ñ She'll only get lost in your mind ñ She's gotta work it for the pleasure of the people ñ She'll only get lost in your mind ñ Sex kitty dances to the heartbeat of a dreamer ñ Watch out, you're just wasting your time ñ With her... ñ You're just wasting your time ñ She's gotta work it for the pleasure of the people...
They say there's a tree in the forest ñ A tree that will give you a sign ñ Come along with me to the sweetheart tree ñ Come and carve your name next to mine ñ They say if you kiss the right sweetheart ñ The one you've been waiting for ñ Big blossoms of white will burst into sight ñ And your love will be true evermore

Shortwave ñ Cold gray rainy Sunday ñ BBC world service ñ I found, I found the strangest music ñ But I lost the station ñ Shortwave ñ Pulls in Oklahoma ñ It's too close to home
I always hurt the ones I love ñ At every opportunity ñ Remorse becomes a second nature ñ Still second to my cruelty ñ How we hurt others is another way ñ In which we hurt ourselves
I hear You calling, calling my name ñ I am longing for Your presence again ñ I come with nothing ñ I lay at Your feet ñ You are waiting waiting for me ñ Show me the way to Your heart ñ Show me the way to Your heart ñ Show me the way to Your heart ñ As I draw near ñ Just as you promised ñ Your Spirit is here ñ You are faithful, the sinners friend ñ The way is open for me to draw near ñ To Your presence, to your presence again

When you walk through a storm ñ Hold your head up high ñ And don't be afraid of the dark ñ At the end of the storm ñ Is the golden sky ñ And the sweet silver song of the lark ñ Walk on through the wind ñ Walk on through the rain ñ Though your dreams be tossed and torn ñ Walk on, walk on with hope in your heart ñ And you'll never walk alone ñ You'll never walk alone ñ Walk on, walk on with hope in your heart ñ And you'll never walk alone ñ You'll never walk alone, alone

You got me singing 5'2" eyes of blue ñ Now you got me singing the blues ñ I was so sad when I realized ñ I made an angel cry ñ Now everybody got their own life ñ And even so do I ñ And nobody got the right to ñ Make an angel cry ñ I never meant to put you down ñ You know how I like to joke around ñ Maybe I joke around a little too much ñ And i never meant to touch you in a bad way ñ You know that I would rather die ñ Than make an angel cry ñ Angel cry ñ Angel cry ñ Angel cry ñ Angel cry
And all the time to loosen up now ñ And every word I made I hate ñ And we caught outside in the moonlight ñ That's how we want it to be ñ But do you really think I suddenly ñ Ever be a son of the moon ñ And wish you had that time ñ But I'm just thinking out the moon ñ Did you feel I'm getting close too ñ But do you feel it will destroy you ñ But do you really think that I slowly, could ever be on son on the moon ñ And hey faith I know all that it has behind your door coldplay ñ Let's keep it cold until we leave
You was the ocean ñ I was the sun ñ So far apart ñ But always in two ñ I have seafoam in my veins ñ I understand the language of the waves ñ Hey! ñ I'll eat your heart out ñ Before you eat mine ñ Boy, don't I tell you all the time ñ I have seafoam in my veins ñ I understand the language of the waves ñ Hey! ñ There is somebody going through ñ Exactly the same thing as you ñ There is somebody going through ñ The exactly the same thing as you ñ Out there ñ Out there ñ Hey! ñ Woah! ñ Come on now! ñ Hey!
Driving me on ñ With the wind in my back ñ There is no turning around now ñ Got my mind in check ñ Epiphany ñ As I hear it's call ñ While observing this cursed world ñ As it swallows us all ñ I see the light ñ Over my bleeding hands ñ But it's fading away now ñ Leaving my faith in strands ñ Epiphany ñ As I hear it's call ñ While observing this cursed world ñ As it swallows us all ñ So, rain ñ Come and wash away my fears ñ In these cold streets below ñ Before they rest on arms reversed ñ In my timewave zero

The seeded truth be bare, my dear ñ Those sub-done potteries come quite clear ñ Those who see both left and right ñ And claw ñ Excive dry bodies for a god to call ñ And I can leave your handy
Staring through ñ The blank dispassionate fire ñ Have I given ñ Too much of myself ñ For this journey ñ This prolonged murder ñ If I was ever alive ñ Or existed ñ I felt only the night ñ Move inside me ñ The falling of shadows ñ That never relinquish ñ Or fly away
Who stole the life from you? ñ Who turned you so against you? ñ Who was the thief, who shaved your teeth ñ Accepting just virtue? ñ Ooh ñ  ñ And did he act alone? ñ Were any more complicit? ñ When he would sing, and offer the ring ñ What older voice said, "kiss it"? ñ Who? ñ  ñ Who? ñ Who? ñ Who? ñ  ñ Fire can't doubt its heat ñ Water can't doubt its power ñ You're not adrift ñ You're not a gift ñ You know you're not a flower

Alasdair, son of exile Cholla ñ In your hand I would entrust deeds ñ Chant... ñ The lord of Ach-nam-breac would be killed ñ By you ñ Chant... ñ He would be buried at the edge of the loch ñ Chant... ñ And although I would get a blow, I heard ñ Yesterday a sad story ñ Chant... ñ That Glasgow was going down
The Brand New Ways I've Been Doing Catching Me Off Guard ñ Yeah You May Not Ever Understand The Way I Am
Just do it ñ I've got it right
Together on the sand ñ We walked hand in hand ñ On the beachfront ñ She smiled at me ñ As she tightly held my hand ñ I had my fingers up her ñ Country music played on the radio ñ So I turned it off ñ We walked down to the water ñ As she grabbed on to my honker ñ A wave swept us away ñ Ahaha, ahaha, ohoho
Hey, it looks wonderful today ñ It 's the perfect day to play 'lonely' ñ Why all the darkness? ñ - Wait for the morning comes' ñ Why all the pain? ñ - Wait here to meet me' ñ They thought always giving me hope ñ They thought I 'd better try on my own ñ They thought in their colorful way ñ They know I'll be back to give love some day ñ Hey, it's high time I got the chance ñ Find the answer at a glance, finally ñ Why are we frightened? ñ - We need this to go on ñ Why are we waiting? ñ - Some thinking has to be done
You know my life, you know my dreams ñ You know my pains, you know my crimes ñ Sad is my mind when I fall in silence...
So, you're gonna waste time? ñ Step back and take your place ñ Always standing on the sideline ñ There's always someone new like you to bring our level down ñ Well, this ain't your town ñ We'll still be her without you ñ Can't you see where we'd doubt you? ñ Had enough of excuses, we don't need this ñ Well, we've had enough this time ñ We're going head to head ñ We've had it with your kind ñ Done letting you fall by the wayside ñ Can't wait to take you on in time
One fine summer morning ñ When the dawn is softly calling ñ To a day that's showing promise ñ Of a lovely summer evening ñ I will take you to the forest ñ Where the mountain meets the ocean ñ We will share the fine silence ñ Another sneaking of devotion ñ And there'll be no need for a dream ñ There's no footsteps there behind us ñ There is no one that can find us ñ There is nothing that combines ñ The feeling shared between us ñ And there'll be no need for a dream?

Liquid consciousness ñ Congealed existence ñ Conceived in profound purpose ñ Suspended over axis ñ Gouged stone gate ñ Carved around chalice ñ Useless cold instrument ñ Puddles the emblem below ñ Conjures the fiend once dormant ñ Through the membrane now aglow ñ Vibrate the word ñ Arise, beast of blood! ñ Radiate its truth ñ We beseech the fiend of rage ñ Devour with talon and tooth
Man takes his cane to a waterfall ñ Has a vision ñ Starts talking baby talk ñ Understood by a girl in Peru ñ We read about it in the daily news ñ Lines of poetry ñ Revealing mysteries ñ Still some can't swim ñ Jesus walked on the water ñ He turned the water into wine ñ He went down to the drunkards ñ To tell them everything is fine ñ You R loved ñ You R loved ñ You R really loved ñ I cannot decide ñ Who should die or live ñ I do my best to forgive ñ Falling backwards in the eventide ñ Listening at the riverside
As one with the Earth ñ No light, no life ñ Deeper you slip ñ Devoured by darkness ñ Grave rats scratch ñ Flesh turns to dust ñ Maggots squirm ñ Eyes frozen shut ñ Burial ñ Burial ñ Burial ñ Burial ñ A portrait of death ñ Unmoving you are ñ This soil is your master ñ These walls are eternal
Every star above, baby ñ Knows the one I love: ñ Sweet Sue - just you! ñ And the moon on high, baby ñ Knows the reason why: ñ Sweet Sue - is you! ñ No one else it seems ñ Ever shared my dreams ñ Without you I don't know what I'd do ñ In this heart of mine ñ You live all the time ñ Ooh, Sue - just you!
Thanks for your words ñ Thanks for your smile ñ Thanks for your arms ñ Sleep well ñ Now is the time for the new flowers ñ It's time for the cherry blossoms to come ñ The pale magnolias ñ The red japonicas ñ And we can walk through the sea of s ñ Under these new blossoms ñ In the warm  breezes ñ And the lighter evenings ñ Thanks for your arms ñ Thanks for your smile ñ Thanks for your words ñ Sleep well ñ Sleep well ñ And I'll see you in the morning
Repulsive thoughts ñ Decaying process of the mind ñ You are deceived ñ The only way to end pain ñ Demonic possession ñ Dark forces forcing infection ñ Your heart hardening ñ Death prepares for harvest ñ Pull the trigger ñ The barrels in your throat ñ Grey matter escaping ñ The blood freely flows ñ Assumed rejection ñ God has never denied you ñ Prepare to burn ñ Only you have rejected Christ ñ Open blind eyes ñ Hold on to precious life ñ Receive his grace ñ His love eternal life
Was I really there, or just a fleeting vision from the corner of your eye? ñ Just a vision of your mind, overwhelmed by that chill inside ñ A glimpse into a world, lost inside of its own despair ñ I can't move on from here until I know that I'm in there ñ Forevermore...
O' Happy day, O' happy day ñ When Jesus washed my sins away! ñ O' Happy day, O' happy day ñ When Jesus washed my sins away! ñ He taught me how ñ He taught me how to watch and pray ñ O' Happy day, O' happy day ñ When Jesus washed my sins away ñ And live rejoicing everyday, live rejoicing everyday ñ O' Happy Day, O' Happy Day
... ñ When I saw you ñ I was frozen ñ I knew that I had already ñ Gone ahead and chosen ñ I was in love with you ñ I see you act the same way ñ Whenever we get near ñ On the verge of tears ñ Darling now I fear ñ I am in love with you ñ I tell you now ñ It's spooky for me too ñ Just to feel this way ñ I don't know what to do ñ I am in love with you ñ I am a strange boy ñ I come from West Virginia ñ I've seen a lot of hard ñ In the avant garde ñ I am in love with you
Uncontious awaken ñ Bleed away the pain ñ All that was is erased ñ My soul reclaim ñ Forever hold eternal what's ñ Left of me ñ This life my disease and dwells ñ Internally empower ñ Embrace me in the son ñ I am weak ñ End what has begun ñ Strengthen me ñ Your will be done ñ I wish to end what has begun ñ I'm alone and die inside ñ Be the light that takes the shadow ñ From my soul ñ All tears will wash away with the ñ Demise of fear ñ Kill sorrow, kill misery, kill sickness ñ Within me
I'm a stranger in your town ñ That's the place I belong ñ Laid behind the frame ñ And the curtain's torn again ñ A wailing saxophone ñ And you know it's all in my song ñ All the sin that I can take ñ But you don't even know my name ñ You've got so sense of fun ñ But you know I've one ñ All the good has turned to bad ñ All you know what I think of that ñ No time to dream ñ No time to sigh ñ No time to kill ñ When love walks by ñ And who's that crying in the street ñ Death is the friend I've yet to meet
Let go ñ Test the limits of desire ñ Let go ñ Penetrate to play with fire ñ Faceless names in nameless places of hope we only find traces ñ Fuck your addiction ñ You're not the only one it's killing ñ Black ink failed ñ Dry well Well dry Will try ñ Will try not to fail ñ I know how this will end ñ Every scar has a story ñ No guts, no glory
The tide is turning ñ We'll be rolling home ñ The fires are burning ñ We will soon be alone ñ To be ñ Forgiven ñ Forgiven ñ Forgiven ñ May the tall trees guide you ñ Let the deep river roll ñ May the moon abide you ñ We will soon be at home ñ To be ñ Forgiven ñ Forgiven ñ Forgiven ñ We have been wrong ñ But the light will save us
Your'e so into this news thing ñ On the the tv set ñ I don't know why you care ñ When wheel of fortune is on next ñ We could watch yuppy famlies ñ Playing for great prizes ñ We could forget about this fucked up world ñ While tv blinds us ñ You're so into your game shows on the tv set ñ When we could watch the world exlpode tonight on channel ten ñ We could watch fucked up families ñ As they fuck eachother ñ WE could forget about the good things in this world together
And at last, I've lived the life that I have longed for ñ All the glamour and the glitter and the glitz ñ Not to mention, by the way, the huge seafood buffet ñ I love my subjects literally to bits ñ As for those ñ Poor unfortunate souls ñ My reign, my rules ñ I'll employ delicious terror from the trenches to the shoals ñ And enjoy sadistic pleasure from the tropics to the poles ñ And, oh boy, I'll get revenge with you-know-who in starring roles ñ Those poor unfortunate souls
Your senseless theories ñ Are rising once again ñ Causing pain within my mind ñ - I'm losing the control ñ But in the kingdom to come ñ Behind the seven seas... ñ Beyond the distant valleys... ñ It's me who decides!!! ñ Your flaming thoughts... ñ ...are tearing my soul apart! ñ I'm harvesting... ñ ...the sow of your curse again! ñ You've destined me to suffer... ñ ...as you were the master! ñ You've taken my inner self... ñ Confusion will rule till I die!!!
Jesus was born today, born in a manger ñ Though He was young they say, He was no stranger ñ He has set me free if I will believe ñ I'm so glad to see it is His birthday ñ Jesus was born today oh how we praise Him ñ Shepherds and wise men say they will adore Him ñ Mighty love has He just for you and for me ñ I'm so glad to say it is His birthday (Happy Birthday) ñ I am so glad He came into my life ñ Gave me life made it right ñ Now everything will be all right ñ 'Cause
It'll happen ñ It's gonna happen babe ñ But it hasn't happened yet ñ I'm not gonna let you get ñ Ahead of yourself ñ It's your Achilles' heel ñ Though I want it as bad as you ñ We've gotta try to see it through ñ Our own excitement ñ Your excitement babe ñ Hasn't let that happen yet ñ And it won't if you forget ñ What happened last time
It'll make you trust your neighbor ñ Respect your fellow man ñ Make you hold your head up high ñ It'll make you do unto others ñ Your very best you can ñ And look yourself right in the eye ñ Well now love is the key that unlocks every door ñ And love, it makes the world go 'round ñ So search your heart and find that key you're looking for ñ And on to happiness you found
This music does not contain words
Always moving ñ Searching for patters ñ Digging for angles ñ Clutching at straws, climbing in air ñ Opening doors, closing windows ñ Swirling ñ Expanding in our world ñ And outside
When you leave your place ñ And walk in someone other's garden ñ Suddenly you see ñ It's a warming colour in your mind to be ñ It is only a garden made of sandwich ñ Marshmallows jumping round and smiling quiet ñ Inside a stone of cream there is a language ñ Bring our minds together, press them tight ñ The rainbow bridge sounds flashbacks of Caruso ñ Beyond eleven dreams are dancing lights ñ For everything you feel there is a do so ñ Your mind it is accepted you are right
I try to explain ñ But you don't listen to me ñ I try to tell you ñ You refuse to care ñ I try to show you ñ But your eyes are closed ñ What else can I do ñ Now it's up to you ñ You're nothing but ñ Cowards ñ And you got no Pride at all at all at all ñ You're nothing but ñ Cowards ñ And you got no pride at all ñ When I turn around ñ You stab my back ñ When I'm out of sight ñ You're spreading lies ñ When I don't see ñ You steal from me ñ Now I know what to do ñ Beat you black and blue
That's the logical explanation ñ Destruction might assume charge or feed belief ñ Passing time again, fun out on the street ñ That's still juvenile preoccupation ñ Standing buttholes, the line goes down the block ñ Familiarity is more convincing ñ Funds available erect the monument ñ Dead is dead I guess ñ What's the cost of a head? ñ That fills your head but you're good for that
Yeah ñ Why don't you show me ñ This is gonna be a heartache something you load me ñ Yeah ñ Why don't you bow me ñ This is gonna be a hard day someone's told me ñ Told me quite before ñ Yeah ñ Why don't you show me ñ This is gonna be a heartache something you load me ñ "Oh, yeah" ñ Why don't you call me ñ You know that I need a girlfriend someday to hold me ñ Hold me at the door
Be not afraid ñ You will never be idle ñ Standing on a cannonball ñ Shooting through space ñ Stay where you are ñ You need no direction ñ No matter where youll ever travel ñ Our headings still the same ñ You can rest ñ The clouds will travel for you ñ You can rest ñ The ball will spin your way
All your days, you're thinking how to just fall away ñ You're always on the cusp ñ All it takes is one more push and shove ñ All your days, you're losing sight of love ñ When no one is around ñ I'll love you when no one is around ñ I'll hold you when no one is around ñ When no one's around
I'm gonna drink a sweeter wine ñ I'm gonna get it right this time ñ I'm gonna finally lose my mind ñ I'm gonna have a little fun ñ I'm gonna let that river run ñ I'm gonna set right with the sun ñ All of the way, all of the way back home again ñ Gonna find out how the circle bends ñ I'm gonna be somebody new ñ Paint my room a brighter blue ñ I'm gonna leave a space for you
Reggae Music ñ Eeeey Reggae music, eeeeey smiley music ñ I wanna save you from tears ñ I wanna break your frontiers ñ In life you see so little cheers ñ Too much misery all these years ñ eeeey reggae music, eeeey smiley music ñ There are times when everything goes wrong ñ Then it's up to you to choose a song ñ Choose it wise don't you wait too long ñ Choose a song to make you strong ñ Eeeey Reggae music, eeeeey smiley music
Now it's done, now it's through ñ The world hates me I know ñ Now I'm out, now I'm done ñ They are staring at me I know ñ Sad and true without you ñ Feeling inside is cruel ñ Reflection, Deflection ñ Picture inside is addle ñ Scream, scream out my heart ñ Scream, Scream it out tonight ñ Now it's gone, now it's true ñ Alone in the world I know ñ Still I'm sad still it feels bad ñ No one's waiting I know ñ Sad but true without you ñ Good times in my mind ñ Oppression affliction ñ Scene inside is getting better
Another night ñ I closing in ñ And I remember ñ All our feelings within ñ I did you wrong ñ And hurt you so ñ I hurt you so ñ (Baby don't go) ñ Baby don't leave me ñ Please don't leave me this way ñ (Baby don't go) ñ Please don't leave me this way ñ I've fallen down ñ From high above ñ And now I'm drowning ñ In the sea of love ñ I want you back ñ Here by my side ñ Can you forgive me ñ Everytime when the night comes ñ I'm waiting ñ I'm waiting ñ Everytime when the night comes ñ I'm waiting ñ For you
Lets fuck, fuck me up in a truck! ñ I like it rough, Doggy Style and stay after for a while!
Twist and shake baby ñ Twist and shake baby ñ Do the twist ñ Do the shake ñ Baby, hey, hey, hey ñ Twist and shout baby ñ Do the twist baby ñ Twist and shake baby ñ Do the shake baby ñ Shake it up baby ñ Twist and shake baby ñ Do the twist ñ How long baby ñ Can ya' do the twist? ñ How long ñ Can ya' do the shake? ñ Twist and shake ñ Twist and shake
I found my thrill, on Blueberry Hill ñ On Blueberry Hill, when I found you ñ The moon stays still, on Blueberry Hill ñ And lingers until, my dreams came true ñ The wind in the willow plays, love's sweet melody ñ But all of the vows you made, were never to be ñ Though we're apart, you're part of me still ñ For you were my thrill, on Blueberry Hill
Let's build a stairway to the stars ñ And climb that stairway to the stars ñ With love beside us to fill the night with a song ñ We'll hear the sound of violins ñ Out yonder where the blue begins ñ The moon will guide us as we go drifting along ñ Can't we sail away on a lazy daisy petal ñ Over the rim of the hill? ñ Can't we sail away on a little dream ñ And settle high on the crest of a thrill! ñ Let's build a stairway to the stars ñ A lovely stairway to the stars
You're opening doors, I'm showing you mine ñ Kill some time, and taking our lifetime away ñ I know I feel lost following you ñ Holding the sign that promised ñ Room for another view ñ I never worry about the wind and rain ñ I never hurry it tell me you're the same ñ I couldn't live with a black tomorrow ñ And I'll be sure that it heard its name ñ Well you know the tale ñ I told you before ñ You're calling the shots ñ Making my reason fly out the door
I am going where I've never been ñ I am going where there's no sin ñ There I will join my lord and my friends ñ Yes I am going where I've never been ñ Don't be crying thoses bitter tears ñ Don't be crying cause I'm not here ñ I'll be happy for the first time in years ñ So don't be crying those bitter tears ñ I have travelled life's weary highways ñ And my last journey is at hand ñ I can hear the Angels calling ñ And I am going where I've never been

I bear the seed of ruin ñ A golden age turned to stone ñ Elysium... to dust ñ For this, a tragic journey ñ A vision of a dying embrace ñ Scattered earth ñ Silence... ñ Where Echonia wept ñ I sank into the silent desert ñ Fallen am I ñ In the solitude of a broken promise ñ ..I cried alone ñ My empyrean is a scar ñ From the memory of her beautiful life ñ Forever was her name ñ Fulfillment lost in a lifetime of regret ñ Ornate peace would cover me ñ As I would die now... ñ For one last wish
Stone sinking under ñ I falter without a thought ñ To say I've been hung is straying from the plot ñ  ñ But I walk, I walk ñ  ñ With shallow voices, misplacing lines on the clock ñ Turning our hands, whimpering doubts ñ No talk, no talk (no talk) ñ Faulty goodbyes, medicated and taught ñ Deprecating lies ñ I falter without a thought ñ  ñ But I walk, I walk
Here I am once again ñ Looking up at the ceiling ñ And what is it I'm afraid of ñ I need somewhere to hide from my neuropsychopathic eye ñ I'm crucified to my mind ñ Slowly drop into a fantod ñ And sound can't pierec through the labyrinth ñ I'm waiting for the trip to start ñ But I'm not ready to fry in my neuropsychopathic eye ñ A splinter flies through my spine ñ Something in your mind you don't realise ñ You don't realise ñ You don't realise
Under saturns rays I rest in eternal sleep dopesmoke violates my tomb and awakens me ñ Clawing from the grave my batwings spread ñ Their blood filled with drugs, so high, so dead ñ Your dope laced blood shows me new highs ñ Bloodlust, druglust, count drugula arise... ñ Strung out on blood I hunt the streets at night ñ Terror from the sky, in batform I strike ñ Your naked body dragged to my darkened crypt ñ I tie you up, dope you up then your blood I sip ñ Drugula.....
A while ago ñ I sold some notes ñ To buy a ring ñ To get married ñ We wholly swore to be together more ñ To sleep and breathe in the same city ñ A while ago ñ You moved to me ñ It's Valentine's Day, and I'm away ñ It's Valentine's Day, and I'm sorry
I was talkin to the whippoorwill ñ He says you got a corny trill ñ Bob White! Whatcha gonna swing tonight? ñ I was talkin to the mocking bird ñ He says you are the worst he's heard ñ Bob White! Whatcha gonna swing tonight? ñ Even the owl-tells me you're foul ñ Singin those lullaby notes ñ Don't be a bring down ñ If you can swing down ñ Gimme those high notes ñ There's a lotta talk about you, Bob ñ And they're sayin you're "off the cob" ñ Fake it, Mister B ñ Take it, follow me, Bob white ñ We're gonna break it up tonight
Sittin' on the guilt step ñ Love and hate -regret ñ Hate and spite -mindset ñ Should've seen it comin' before ñ Thinkin' bout the last time ñ Never be a next time ñ Never thought you'd cross the line ñ  ñ I have seen the writings n the wall ñ I will watch as your castles fall ñ Down----------------down ñ Fuckin' with myself ñ Dreamin' 'bout money wealth ñ Livin' in the poor house ñ Should've seen it comin' before ñ Thinkin' bout the last time ñ Never be a next time ñ Never thought you'd cross the line ñ Should've seen it comin'
Lyrics from Snippet ñ  You don't give a fuck, damn this isn't fair ñ End the trust when you in affair ñ Found the dirt and up in nowhere ñ Called your bluff but you didn't care ñ I'm moving on well I thought ñ His stirring wheel on my car ñ I'm s'posed to leave but I stopped ñ From driver 
Open your heart ñ Open your heart ñ Open your heart ñ  ñ I believe in the power of love ñ (I believe) ñ I believe in the power of love ñ (I believe) ñ I believe in the power of love ñ I believe in the power of love ñ Feel the power
Soundwaves surround us ñ One waves comes later ñ The two waves together ñ Crossed lines at bottom and top ñ Soundwaves ñ Two waves together ñ They're complex like two eyes ñ Or headphones, right and left ñ Right and left
You probably think you're going to Heaven ñ Even though you put me through hell ñ I know you won't pick up my calls ñ But darling if these walls could talk
Towers... ñ Deity forged architecture ñ Swirling in and out of form ñ Enveloped in the arms of dark matter ñ Towers...mercurial and flowing... ñ My work is done ñ Pillars... ñ From an antediluvian bane ñ Collapsing in and out of form ñ Embodied in a cradle of absence ñ Pillars...mercurial and flowing... ñ My work is done ñ By way of light across a vast millennia ñ I can behold this grandeur at its infancy ñ Though I know it has already passed away a millennia before ñ My work has begun...
Here's to John Wesley Hardin, ñ No man was quicker on the draw. ñ Many men tried his meddle, ñ And found it wasn't wanting lead. ñ Think of Jane when you judge him; ñ She loved and lost a wanted man. ñ Gaming tables were turning ñ Against the man who learned the law. ñ Wes the Winner was losing, ñ To fall with bullets in his back. ñ Bottoms up to a Texan, ñ What's more, a relative of mine.
Cross the lines down shifting lights ñ Catch it's breath a stream of life ñ The tallest trees stretch to the sea ñ And to the edge where shadows meet ñ A quiet place and nature's way ñ A season comes and whispers life ñ Still born again into golden dreams ñ A Hiding place beneath blue skies ñ Cross the lines down shifting lights ñ Catch it's breath a stream of life ñ The tallest trees stretch to the sea ñ And to the edge where shadows meet
(Chorus) ñ Maybe light a candle ñ Don't say a prayer for me ñ Feel alone ñ Cause I'm gone ñ I left you ñ Make Christmas your own ñ Yes, throw the thought of us away ñ You'll be alone this holiday ñ It's cold in this town ñ And there's snow on the ground ñ Far from home ñ Not alone ñ I left you with nothing ñ And that's what you own ñ Yeah, throw the thought of us away ñ You'll be alone this holiday ñ (Repeat Chorus) ñ You throw the thought of us away ñ You'll be alone this holiday
What up, it's the astronaut kid, the designer kid ñ Future and you rocking with me ñ Dirty Sprite, yeah ñ The drink muddy, nigga ñ I'm taking that shit to a whole 'notha level ñ It's been a motherfucking movie ñ It's epic, motion picture, understand that ñ Double salute to the streets, did it for us ñ A1 since day one, Freeband gang ñ Shoutout to the world
Every morning when I wake up ñ I'm feeling kinda minimal ñ In the daylight when I'm walking ñ I'm feeling just passable ñ Don't I feel, don't I feel like a mineral? ñ Don't I feel, don't I feel like a vegetable? ñ In the evening when I'm flying ñ I feel just like an animal ñ In the nighttime when I'm sleeping ñ I'm finally feeling half able ñ Feeling just passable ñ Don't I feel, don't I feel like a mineral? ñ Don't I feel, don't I feel like a vegetable?
I woke from my sleep last night ñ All sweaty with quite a fright ñ I looked to see if you're next to me ñ Somehow i knew you wouldn't me ñ It seems that my dreams only come ñ When my dreams aren't about you ñ Nightmares are all you bring to me ñ I'll keep searching for you ñ Lonely days and sleepless nights ñ This doesn't feel so right ñ I found myself expecting more ñ Than i did, did before ñ Seems that my dreams only come ñ When my dreams aren't about you ñ Nightmares are all you bring to me ñ I'll keep searching for you
Why is it that we creep? ñ Why is it that we seek? ñ And seeking do not find ñ Or finding do not know ñ (Mommy, mommy, mommy) ñ I - I don't want to know
Figment options stand upon platforms of contention promoting themselves as products. Their proposals are ultimatums and nothing more than a higher form of bribery, mere scenery for the self identured and parasite to a false sense of obligation. No choices offer solutions
For virtue, meditation ñ Writing checks my ass can't cash ñ Wearing weed for the weekend? ñ Fuck vacation ñ ... ñ (Incomplete)
Dan expands like Gildersleeve: ñ "You salty dogs, it's New Year's Eve." ñ The Dali drools, the Hartley shines ñ But all I see is those Burchfield Nines ñ The artist weeps, the agent smiles; ñ I'd like to learn to box like Miles ñ We're all such funny valentines ñ But all I see is those Burchfield Nines ñ The women purr like Cheshire cats ñ And Mr. T. breaks out the V.A.T ñ And on the box Bird tingles spines ñ But all I see is those Burchfield Nines
There are many imitators ñ But we are the true creators ñ We're back ñ We are back
I used to sit by my fireplace ñ And dream about you ñ But now that won't do ñ There's a flaw in my flue ñ Your lovely face in my fireplace ñ Was all that I saw ñ But now it won't draw ñ My flue has a flaw ñ From every beautiful ember a memory arose ñ Now I try to remember and smoke gets in my nose ñ It's not as sweet as the unit-heat ñ To dream about you ñ So darling, adieu ñ There's a flaw in my flue
That's right, yep ñ I've just got... ñ Oh, oops! (laughing) ñ (Homeshake) Shh, be quiet be quiet ñ (Homeshake) ñ He sounds like a really nice guy.

Thoughts that I can't erase ñ Brought from a distant place ñ But for a twist of fate ñ Africa could be my home
(Ring me in, Ringo) ñ Ah fuck, guys, it's raining ñ God damn it, it is rain ñ We got to cancel the trip, guys ñ 'Cause of the fucking rain ñ  ñ Man, didn't you read the fucking news? ñ It said it was raining, damn it, you fucking idiot (Ah, shut up, Paul) ñ  ñ Fuck you both ñ Why did you form a fucking band anyways? ñ Fuck ñ  ñ This is a fucking disaster ñ I'm gonna go do some acid ñ Peace and love, Ringo

I never wanted more than the beauty of your kiss. Somehow I get lost in the sound of this singing ñ But, you're beautiful tonight, in your ultraviolet light. Kiss me softly and sing to me ñ I'd give anything... ñ I never wanted more. Show me how to do it, help me find a way. I've got nothing left to live for ñ No one else is staying, but you, always you. There is only you
One day he woke up and he was ill ñ He tried to be like us ñ He tried to kill all our friends ñ We locked him in a cage but he was still loud and so we left ñ We don't know him anymore ñ We heard of him in 1985 ñ He attacked three people with a knife ñ When he died we didn't shed a tear ñ This alien was ill ñ We don't love him anymore ñ You never watched him play with the big toys ñ We never thought that he could be so cruel ñ It was nice to watch him play with the big toys ñ We never thought that he could be so cruel
Been out on the road about six months too long ñ I want you so bad, I can hardly stand it ñ I am so tired and I am all alone ñ We will soon be together and that is it ñ  ñ I am coming home to your love ñ  ñ Hitch-hiking on the turnpike all day long ñ Nobody seemed to notice, they just pass me on by ñ To keep from going crazy, I got to sing my song ñ Got a whole lot of loving and baby, that is why ñ  ñ  ñ Coming home
Put down all your weapons ñ Let me in through your open wounds
We'll meet again, don't know where, don't know when ñ But I know we'll meet again some sunny day ñ Keep smiling through just like you always do ñ Till the blue skies drive the dark clouds far away ñ And won't you please say "Hello" to the folks that I know ñ Tell them I won't be long ñ They'll be happy to know that as you saw me go ñ I was singing this song ñ We'll meet again, don't know where, don't know when ñ But I know we'll meet again some sunny day
I'm blue and lonesome as a man can be ñ I'm blue and lonesome, ooh, as a man can be ñ I don't have headaches about myself ñ My love has gone away from me ñ  ñ Baby, please come back to me ñ Baby, please come home to me ñ Yes, my heart is full of misery ñ Baby, you won't be sweet to me ñ  ñ I'm gonna cast my trouble ñ Down in the deep blue sea ñ I'm gonna cast my trouble, yeah ñ Down in the deep blue sea ñ Where the whales and the fishes ñ Have no fuss over me
Past the Atlantic gaps and the spaces it has ñ From a birthing home to a find a place ñ We all counteract with visions intact ñ With great impossibles and most crowded doorways ñ I have the greatest plan involving everyone else ñ We all and a map of muses travel to shores ñ Scarred with wars, we'll never be apart again ñ Hold on to your faces
I don't understand why you ran away ñ I kept up searching for ya till I lost my faith ñ The sky's the reason why I lost my soul ñ And I'm, I, I'm the reason why you lost control
Looking back to find ñ What went wrong this time ñ We're falling to pieces ñ We fall out of line ñ We fall into holes in empty times ñ I will try to undestand you ñ I will turn this all around ñ The world grows colder ñ I'm your shoulder ñ I will turn this all around ñ I can't find myself ñ And you were lost as well ñ Never wait on a miracle ñ Got nothing to loose ñ And everything to gain
Hold it up ñ Get lost enough ñ You've still got your luck ñ You're miles ñ From the love you made ñ Even heaven gets rough ñ Ghosts were meant for bleeding ñ Ghosts were meant for bleeding ñ When you see your wall ñ And you have it all ñ Broken apart ñ You follow through ñ If you bruise it ñ So eat your heart out ñ It hates to hope and leave it ñ It hates to hope and leave it ñ So the story rolls ñ And the golden boys ñ And girls get tired ñ You look for life ñ On blurry nights ñ When home is hardly a word
God is good ñ We sing and shout it ñ God is good ñ We celebrate ñ God is good ñ No more we doubt it ñ Gos is good ñ We know it's true ñ And when i think ñ Of his love for me ñ My heart fills with praise ñ And i feel like dancing ñ For in his heart ñ There is no room for me ñ And i run with arms ñ Opened wide

Is everybody tucked in ñ Is everybody tucked in ñ Now that's what I like to see ñ And what can ya do for me for free ñ Is everybody tucked in ñ New york ñ Chicago chicago chicago ñ Los Angeles, there's something nice to be said ñ There is something nice to be said (bout) Los Angeles ñ (comfort air ñ Comfort ride ñ Comfort flex ñ Comfort zone) ñ Way into the trance thing ñ Trance thing ñ Is everybody tucked in ñ Two ways to skin ñ No room to swing ñ Is everybody tucked-in
I know that you're really nice ñ And things aren't always what you'd like ñ But I know I've been told I want to be alone ñ I know you ñ You're so cool ñ Same words have been spoken ñ Same feelings now old and blue ñ I'll see you alone, alone ñ Yes, I will buy you things ñ I know you ñ You're so cool ñ I know you ñ All my friends are you
I found a jetty of stone ñ And I'm standing on my own ñ The lake enclosed ñ Array away filled sky ñ Hovering over space and time ñ Streams on at once ñ And I tread line think twice ñ As I spiral through the cold ñ Wet tide of stones ñ And what sueds the need of a man ñ Weaving traces on the land ñ Like so many scars
I'm waiting for something new ñ The rain washes my thoughts away ñ I'm longing to sing this song ñ To show you, to hold you ñ I'm so nervous, so excited ñ You make me feel, feel I'm not alone ñ  ñ It's you, just you
BIG AS A MOUNTAIN ñ Watch out, she's big as a mountain ñ Slobby slow witch called Ree Lyndon ñ Like you got something to believe in ñ Leave you with a golden ribbon
You are too beautiful ñ My dear, to be true ñ And I am a fool for beauty ñ Fooled by a feeling ñ That because I had found you ñ I could have bound you to me ñ You are too beautiful ñ For one man alone ñ One lucky fool to be with ñ When there are other men ñ With eyes of their own ñ To see with ñ Love does not stand sharing ñ Not if one cares ñ Have you been comparing ñ My every kiss with theirs? ñ If on the other hand ñ I'm faithful to you ñ It's not from a sense of duty ñ You are too beautiful ñ And I am a fool ñ For beauty
The light from the window ñ Falls on the floor ñ And after it breaks ñ I cut my feet ñ On the little bright pieces ñ (I glow in the dark) ñ But only when night falls ñ It's falling it's falling ñ It's falling it's falling ñ It falls ñ My head is a night-club ñ Club-clubbed to dull drums ñ Beating too slow ñ To dance or to breathe or to dance ñ I insist that you cut in ñ (I a la flamb? ñ I'm drinking I'm drinking ñ I'm drinking I'm drinking ñ I'm drunk ñ Dull day
I hear the sound of a voice inside ñ Keeping me awake in the middle of the night ñ Telling me to make  wrong things right ñ I hear the sound of a voice inside ñ I hear the sound of a voice inside ñ Keeping me awake in the middle of the night ñ Telling me to make  wrong things right ñ I hear the sound of a voice inside! ñ  ñ I hear the echoes ñ I hear the echoes ñ Follow the echoes ñ Echoes, echoes ñ I hear the echoes ñ I hear the echoes ñ Follow the echoes ñ Echoes, echoes
This music does not contain words
Well my flags at half staff ñ And I can't find my better half ñ Don't know where lonesome stops and love starts
You know what's going on ñ Think we'll make it through? ñ It's all okay, we will always be together ñ We'll save a broken heart ñ Think we'll make it through? ñ It's all okay, we will always be together
To fizz like soda you recognise in water ñ To dream so porous, you never take much notice ñ We're chemicals in penance ñ A tangled lump of minute hand ñ Our shape is in the moment ñ That wonder how you reap an end ñ You wanna kick your damage? ñ I'm a piece of chicken too to say it ñ For anybody magic ñ To empathise a simple aching ñ It beat a lot of traffic ñ Them baby eyes so constipating ñ Your freak enough to manage ñ To keep this heat from complicating ñ To one, one, one, the mega of one! ñ To the mega of one!
Lyrics From Snippet ñ Let the people talk 'cause I know that they assume (Assume) ñ Swipe her off her feet I ain't even have a broom ñ That's the motion ñ Only need it for two minutes I got her open ñ Living like I'm Bob Marley, I'm always smokin' ñ We don't do no 1 on 1s, I'm not..

Remember me, though I have to say goodbye ñ Remember me, don't let it make you cry ñ For even if I'm far away, I hold you in my heart ñ  ñ I'll sing a secret song to you each night we are apart ñ Remember me, though I have to travel far ñ Remember me, each time you hear a sad guitar ñ  ñ Know that I'm with you the only way that I can be ñ Until you're in my arms again, remember me

Oh and after the lighter day ñ I will ñ Come to you ñ After needing you ñ So long ñ Yes after the lighter day ñ I will ñ Come to you ñ After needing you ñ So long
Light burns my eyes ñ Prayer splits my ears ñ Everything is complicated ñ I am in the warmth of the shadow of a shade ñ Lingering fear, unseeable shadows ñ I am held in arms of hallucination ñ I engrave permanent scars in myself ñ In endless nauseous days

The pandemic got us up, my man did it now he's up ñ Trump giving nigga's loans, unemployed nigga's homes ñ Run applaud niggas home, take you shopping from the king ñ You ain't popping you a fed, counting niggas bands ñ Watching on the gram, pocket watching on ya man ñ These chrome hearts ain't got no pockets ñ Im cold hearted when I cock it, you a mark on the market ñ I'm in the target like a Target, stick the cartridge when I park it ñ Dump out when I jump out, you just run mouth nigga stop it
Your eyes can touch me ñ Your scent can embrace me ñ Your voice can graze my skin ñ And that's what I'll miss most of all ñ I want to believe it ~ ñ And trust what the body can know ñ But the body lies ñ Your eyes evade me ñ Your silence betrays me ñ The lies your body told were so unkind ñ And I couldn't face it ~ ñ I was a cliche, and behold ñ You couldn't save my soul ñ I couldn't face it ñ I couldn't face what I know ñ The body lies ñ My body lied ñ Your body lied ñ The body lies
See the leaves falling from the trees ñ Nothing that can hold them together ñ Fever is passing over me ñ Changing my outlook forever
Though I walk through the valley ñ Of the shadow of death ñ I fear no evil ñ I am a worm; Evil men despise me ñ My strength dried up ñ They pierce my hands and feet ñ Count all my bones ñ To dogs I am prey ñ My heart turned to wax ñ Melted away ñ Come quickly to help me ñ Deliver my life from the blade ñ The suffering of the afflicted one ñ In dust of death, I am laid

Agent orange skies hang bright above ñ This high school gym ñ Where they believe we're so happy young ñ And look like pink decorations ñ In our very best crystals ñ Oh and how i wanted to dance ñ So badly ñ Agent orange skies hang bright ñ Behind these factory lights ñ Oh jump the freight trains ñ We're fucking young ñ And look like pink decorations ñ In our crystal meth tuxedos ñ Oh and how i wanted to dance ñ So badly

Stalking the victims ñ Learn what they're about ñ Weaklings they all are ñ Come. I will tell ñ I am the conqueror ñ I am the one you fear ñ I am the atrocity ñ Unbelievable sickness ñ In my mind ñ First. I get to know one ñ I'll let it think that it know me ñ Once, you trust me, the nightmare will begin ñ You'll believe in me. I believe in it ñ Let the bludgeoning show my concem ñ My children ñ Pain is no real, only a dream ñ Fear not my blade
Are you broken? ñ Are you leaving? ñ Is your blood red? ñ Are you breathing? ñ Are you broken? ñ Are you leaving? ñ Is your blood red? ñ Are you breathing? ñ Are you bleeding?
Trace the essence of the sparks ñ Though the light you seek ñ Can deceive you to an endless spiral ñ Why do you fight ñ Against the truth that you hide? ñ Shades of dusk will embrace ñ The fountain of lies ñ Your beliefs are thrown into the wind ñ Why do you fight ñ Against the truth that you hide? ñ There is still a burning within me ñ And it will never fade away...
Can everybody see it? ñ Does everybody know? ñ I'm mad about you baby ñ But I don't want to let it show ñ Can everybody feel it? ñ The passion in the air ñ Or is it all in my mind ñ Am I just wishing ñ Living for your smile ñ I can't get enough of you ñ You're ruling my mind ñ I ain't giving up on you ñ Some day you'll be mine ñ Can everybody hear it? ñ What lies between my lines ñ It's not the words I'm saying ñ It's what is in my eyes ñ See I'm losing my cool because of you ñ I'm living for your smile
Befriend a bastard, a thief as your brother ñ Heard him say what's yours is mine ñ Careful when gouging yourself with what's holy ñ I see through your transparent lies ñ Skeleton symphonies play psalms to tell you ñ Your venom has blinded your eyes ñ Make sure your rope is real strong when you hang me ñ Better make sure that I die ñ Your name became Judas the moment I helped you ñ Should've just let it all lie ñ If Mammon's the reason for killing your hero ñ Choke on your evil disguise
Sample: SPEAKER 1: That they are all a bunch of spiritual retards with a bunch of brain (?????) for creatures and they haven't figured out that this thing is for real and we are in a war! ñ SPEAKER 2: ....say sir your talk and your rhetoric, this is war, we are at war, and I think for instance...(fades and echoes into gibberish) ñ *Leeb is whispering something during this, but its too buried to understand*

And the olive trees, for the locust devoured them as well ñ You will not let me die ñ Why not ñ The trees and fields have been picked dry yet you keep me here for what ñ To sit at your side. Let me die young and empty of days ñ Bury my bones under the bare olive tree ñ Let my name rest on the tip of your tounge ñ As the night captured our still voices ñ The contrast of the sky locks our eyes one last time
Tears have formed this river, tainted by the blood that stains ñ Dead sun leave me. The pale moon is rising. Take my hand and feel nothing ñ Watch me fall and say nothing. Starve me and tease me ñ Feed me and leave. Just leave. Please
Cristian infiltration ñ You've got your biblical vision ñ Wanting to instill it on hardcore ñ With conservative precision ñ This ain't no cross on my hand ñ This x on my hand is no dead mans stigmata ñ Centuries of hate disguised on pamphlet at a show ñ Impressionable kids believe it but they haven't lived enough to know ñ This ain't no cross on my hand ñ Underneath all the false promises and peace ñ Is nothing but a bunch of lies and the end of you and me ñ This ain't no cross on my hand
PLEASE ADD THIS SONG

Sevyn: I have a big heart, I love really hard. If I love you once, I love you forever. If my ex came back and really tried to have a conversation with me, and he's now begging me to have 30 minute conversations, when he had 2 years ñ By ignoring someone is the best way to get them back ñ Man that's the best way to hurt yourself ñ Once you respond, all that does is show them that you still care
Suicide run ñ Choosing death ñ Under the gun ñ Darkness ahead ñ Shoot the relief ñ Destroy only self ñ Bitter world ñ Escape into hell ñ Failing, sliding; never die! ñ Strengthened, rising; never die! ñ Powered, fighting; never die! ñ Remaining relentless ñ The policy we face is tactical genocide ñ Pulling the trigger on the troubled mind ñ Addiction to kill, ambition in our eyes ñ Never to speak, never to rise ñ Try to keep me silent, but I choose to be... ñ Never die ñ Relentless
Lock the door, thin the light ñ Here's the tale for you tonight ñ Let me take you away ñ Well, take my hand and follow me ñ Mother Mary's child to be ñ Well, I got something to say ñ Rainbow warrior ñ Shine on ñ Rainbow warrior ñ Sign your will across the sky ñ Follow me 'til the day you die ñ One for all and all for one ñ Walking through the gates of dawn ñ We've been waiting so long ñ Children sent from near and far ñ Come and see their newborn star ñ See it shining so strong
Do you have a face ñ I can measure the day by ñ How alive?
Can you come thru? Baby, I need.. ñ Your love and holyness, the one true girl I need. ñ She holds me so tight, her coffin is where I sleep. ñ Six sudden holes in my heart, I-i-i bleed.. ñ Wrap your lies around my throat so I can't breathe. ñ Bear traps keep trapping me, covered in the blood of my family. ñ Can you see my soul? Covered in mossy leaves. ñ Dissected me so fast, how did you know my past?
I believe in angels

Medicine man never asking twice ñ About the what is and what is not ñ The fine line in between has been cut short ñ And replaced by pens mightier than the sword ñ Doctor ñ Tell her the verdict
Mysterium Tremendum ñ Bring your mind before me ñ And I shall lay it to rest ñ A shimmering dream ñ Between being and nothing ñ There's no difference if you ask ñ Or decide to remain silent ñ There are no ideas of tomorrow ñ There's only forever today ñ One concealed by many ñ Unable to understand ñ With no ideas of yesterday ñ There's only forever today ñ A hall of broken mirrors ñ And masks behind masks ñ Without the darkness ñ There is no revelation
The thoughts, they slide hanging between the past, that has coiled my body with long heavy chains, and the future that doesn't belong to me and that sinks more and more into oblivion ñ Flashes of certainties rip from the sky of non-existence while tall flames burn down my sighs ñ I'm lost in the madness of this darkness... Of this perversion ñ A sharp dream that makes my soul bleed...
My room's the universe ñ I lay here on the floor ñ And look up at the stars ñ And my mind is fine ñ For a little while ñ My room's the universe ñ I sit and play guitar ñ And my gut isn't hurting now ñ I lay down ñ I breathe in and out ñ In and out for a little while ñ My room's the universe and I'm a molecule  ñ A simple molecule ñ Oh yeah ñ My room's the universe, and I am dust
Oh, it's dark, the sun went down, the power's still out ñ Oh, it's cold, my blood barely flows ñ Oh, I'm alone, except for the sound of insects flying ñ Around they know my red blood is warm still
Lyrics from Snippet ñ Sleep until somebody shake my body off the cushion ñ Maybe call my baby just to  walk the ñ Wait, that's not my baby song, wrapped up like tamales ñ Wear different color diamonds 'cause my stylist wasn't with me ñ I can't even be mad, this shit ain't that bad ñ I could be an Instagram model ñ Fuckin' around, the streets of L.A. ñ With nowhere to go and that look on her face like
In the shade of every moment I bled ñ Such a sorrow was to be expected ñ I let a good thing go ñ I let a good thing go ñ Now every feeling it kicks me to the bone ñ And takes me under to a place that I have known ñ There goes my quiet life I used to keep me warm ñ In the shade of this moment I am born ñ I let a good thing go ñ I let a good thing go ñ In the shade of every moment I bled ñ Such a sorrow was to be expected ñ I let a good thing go ñ I let a good thing go ñ Good thing go
She was marrying a matador and he was with the weather girl ñ A very clever girl who stood out amongst several ones ñ A terrible dilemma and forever he'll regret the day ñ He didn't make the rescue from the bullring ñ Sulking won't get you nowhere, son ñ There's blood on your chin where you've bitten your tongue ñ Smitten, but might not be smitten for long ñ If you're still sitting, she'll soon be smitten and gone

Lyrics from snippet ñ I made the choice,  ñ So give  all
A mockery* ñ This suffering is a remedy for the dullness ñ Ritual void for cave life ñ Parallel life of the stimulated ñ Reincarnated storms ñ Waves of truth ñ Quest for the ocean ñ Weary of this wavering world ñ A solitary path of seeking ñ The next moment of majesty ñ The tallest forest ñ Unveiled ñ As I step inside the night ñ Petrified moments ñ Reincarnated storms ñ Waves of truth ñ Quest for the ocean ñ Everything eliminated ñ Luciferian infiltration ñ Tree of life tied to roots of inner earth
Okay, now-- Now we're gonna play something that contains within--within it--its own devious little boogie. But before you get to the boogie there's a bunch of weird stuff on either side of it. And the name of this tune is "Little Dots." And it features Dave Parlato on bass and Jim Gordon on drums, grinding it out
Southern trees bear strange fruit ñ Blood on the leaves and blood at the root ñ Black bodies swinging in the southern breeze ñ Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees ñ  ñ Pastoral scene of the gallant South ñ Of the bulging eyes and the twisted mouth ñ Scent of magnolias, sweet and fresh ñ Then the sudden smell of burning flesh ñ  ñ Here's a fruit for the crows to pluck ñ For the rain to gather, for the wind to suck ñ For the sun to rot, for the trees to drop ñ Here is a strange and bitter crop
There's a world where ñ I can go and ñ Tell my secrets to ñ In my room ñ In my room ñ In this world I ñ Lock out all my ñ Worries and my fears ñ In my room ñ In my room ñ Do my dreaming and my scheming ñ Lie awake and pray? ñ Do my crying and my sighing ñ Laugh at yesterday? ñ Now it's dark and ñ I'm alone but ñ I won't be afraid ñ In my room ñ In my room ñ In my room, in my room ñ In my room, in my room
Bury me in a shallow grave ñ So the rain will wash me away ñ And the sun will burn my soul ñ And the earth will feed on me ñ The earth must drink ñ My sour blood to breathe ñ My disease is caustic pain ñ I'm stumbling but I'm trying to say ñ That I'm crumbling away ñ In the corner you'll find me ñ On the back of the bus ñ Sterile, sterile vision
I don't wanna go out. It's up to the ocean ñ Where the wind is blown ñ And I could sit high up on top of a hill ñ In the grasses, so tall ñ And I never wanna see you, don't ñ Wanna see you at all ñ And I never wanna hear your voice ñ Like you call ñ  ñ True love knows ñ When it's left alone ñ But it hurts so badly ñ Who did it to you ñ Why'd you do it to me? ñ True love knows ñ When it's left alone ñ I'd be blind if I didn't see ñ I did it to you ñ When you'd do it to me
Lyrics from Snippet ñ  ñ Oh, oh, oh ñ Oh, oh, oh ñ Cruising, tour out ñ About to make me toss my head ñ To pain in soul ñ  ñ Loving her left my life stolen ñ Promises we both made, broken ñ Now we wait, in our sorrows, soakin' (So you say) ñ 'Fore you say...
Woman: Honey? ñ Man: Uh huh? ñ Woman: There's something I've been needing to tell you for a long time ñ Man: Okay ñ Woman: I'm so sorry, but..... ñ Oh, God ñ How am I gonna say this? ñ It's not your child ñ Man: What? ñ (car crashing sound)
There was a thought at the beginning of time ñ All lives were known yours and mine ñ A conscious thought ñ A thought of love ñ Dance round the fire ñ Dance round the fire ñ You say to me ñ A chemical reaction ñ To create new life ñ Create mankind ñ But don't you feel that deep inside ñ Dance round the fire ñ Dance round the fire ñ Won't you sell my soul ñ Down, down and down...
We're just like you, in the things we never do, and you're just like us, you gravitate towards people you don't trust. can you pull yourself right down? can you make it all fall down? then you know what to do. when you see it roll back to two, well that's zero return. when you see it roll back to three, crack the glass just out of reach, and when it flashes to zero return, think by now that you'd have learned, but that's zero return
Fortunes and home ñ It mean to only roll ñ You sit atop my land ñ And took the only wall ñ Do you want to feel my heart? ñ I could be (I could be) inside your ñ Inside your... ñ I look for rolling ñ And took the only wall ñ Do you want to feel my heart? ñ I could be (I could be) inside you ñ Inside your...
Everything begins in sequence ñ Everything begins in time ñ Everything begins with rhythm ñ Everything begins with rhyme. (All the bodies fall in line.) ñ We design the future and we design the want ñ Anything anymore controlling has to stop ñ All just victims of the fashion ñ Meaningless and mindless drones ñ Lost beyond my comprehension ñ Faux rebellion from catalogues
The clouds gather ñ The dark skies loom ñ The thunder claps ñ A life filled tomb ñ Life filled tomb ñ The earth that we once knew ñ Defunct, desolate in view ñ Disease and death abound ñ This era I am crowned ñ The mortals run in fear ñ Their lives soon disappear ñ Saved from a life of lies ñ Silenced but for their cries ñ But for their cries ñ But for their cries ñ Now I'm crowned ñ Now I'm crowned ñ Now I'm crowned ñ Now I'm crowned ñ Just as I saw, by his majestys law ñ Now I'm crowned ñ Now I'm crowned ñ Lifeless / extinct

There's wheat in the field ñ And water in the stream ñ And salt in the mine ñ And an aching in me ñ I can no longer stand and wonder ñ Cause I'm driven by this hunger ñ So I'll jug some water ñ Bake some flour ñ Store some salt and wait the hour ñ While I'm thinking of love ñ Love is thinking for me ñ And the baker will come ñ And the baker I'll be ñ I am depending on my labor ñ The texture and the flavor
So little or no ñ Knowledge of this ñ Inject into the heart ñ Fatal first kiss ñ So much, all too much ñ Feelings of guilt ñ Stare into your own eyes ñ Walls being built ñ Stay calm, don't run ñ Put your gun down ñ In the hand of your love ñ Your tears will drown ñ Left inside it all ñ Leave it up to her ñ Breach the wailing wall ñ I won't die unsure ñ Dissect your dead god ñ And repair it ñ Sharpen the chosen fork ñ And make it fit

Eye for eye ñ Tooth for tooth ñ You'll get yours ñ Before it's through ñ Living war ñ Up to your knees in blood ñ What are you dying for? ñ Peace and love? ñ Kill for peace ñ Kill for land ñ Killing time? ñ Vengeance is mine ñ Blood is thicker than water ñ Land is worth more than gold ñ Oil leads man to the slaughter ñ Greed will eat at your soul ñ Terrorists threaten our streets ñ So now they are mine fields ñ All powers will be unleashed ñ When killing is fashion we all must kill ñ (1st & 3rd solo MB, 2nd solo LL)
Face, such a beautiful face ñ But time waits for no one ñ So why don't we get it on, yeah ñ Love, I see it in lies ñ It shines like the winter sun ñ So why don't we get it on ñ Waste, such a terrible waste ñ Cos time waits for no one ñ So why don't we get it on, get it on

These words they make the world spin here in steady rotation ñ Until the new words turn the new world into oblivion ñ Well, at the end of the line and this new world feels pretty rotten ñ Then we'll go our separate ways to put new blood in our system ñ I've never seen eyes so hurt, the kind that scream my name ñ Now what can I make of life when it all seems like a game? ñ I've gotta tie up all my loose ends 'fore my skin turns to mange ñ So I've gotta look at the sky and imagine I've found my place

Begging to differ ñ Your reign will soon be over ñ The recipe for your demise ñ Has been boiled down ñ You need the courage ñ To get the heart you always needed ñ The road will be long ñ But soon you'll get there ñ Shameless, shameless ñ Trickery makes us timeless ñ But we never had a choice ñ And we never had a voice ñ Violence, violence ñ Blood red colored romance ñ And your scent gives you away ñ Gives us all away ñ Wide awake ñ The secret
I am a dark ñ I see the cities' torn scars ñ I find the raw back streets ñ I know a back world ñ I see kings and queens at night ñ In a world of neon lights ñ I see crimes and skylines ñ I've seen the night world burn ñ Only they who have loved ñ Only they who have yearned ñ Only they who have burned ñ Only they can know me ñ I am a dark star
Shelter ñ Punishment for intolerance ñ So entertain us when you're still ñ Able to perform ñ I'm sorry to admit ñ That i won't be arround ñ When the world you created ñ Will colapse and drown ñ And drown ñ Back to the crypts, nothing will last ñ We'll all fade away in one single blast ñ Out from the dust, machines arise ñ One second lef to live ñ Then will open your eyes ñ I can't find shelter in this world ñ I'm searching for another world ñ Where i feel safe
If to distant lands I scatter ñ If I sail to farthest seas ñ Would you find and firm and gather ñ 'Til I only dwell in Thee? ñ If I flee from greenest pastures ñ Would you leave to look for me? ñ Forfeit glory to come after ñ 'Til I only dwell in Thee ñ If my heart has one ambition ñ If my soul one goal to seek ñ This my solitary vision ñ 'Til I only dwell in Thee ñ That I only dwell in Thee ñ 'Til I only dwell in Thee
I just saw an alien go by ñ And I could swear that they came for me ñ I dreamt of them all last night ñ They came to show me things I've never seen ñ Like a hundred tiny hands that take your jacket ñ Or a ship thats made entirely of bones ñ Or a ray that dulls all your senses ñ A time capsule you take to stunt your growth ñ I can't wait 'til i get home ñ In the furthest depths of the unknown
Shows the video tile "word unscramble". ñ Asks the viewer whether they can unscramble the letters "JOY". ñ Shows the text "answer next week!".
Lilacs in my mind all the time are blooming beautifully ñ Even though some stare and say her last affair went brutally ñ Well, I don't let them rain on my parade ñ That's not my thing ñ 'Cause I've got love on my side, now ñ I've got nothing to hide, now ñ And now life's a dream ñ Life's a dream
Calling to me, coming for me ñ Velvet flesh, howling in lust ñ Possession, of my soul ñ Cadavera ñ Cadavera comes for me ñ I dream of demons ñ Broken wings bleed ñ I dream of demons ñ And her touch ñ I dream of demons ñ Every night ñ I dream of demons ñ And demons I fuck! ñ Burning eyes, eternal pain ñ Feeding me, feeding desires ñ Obedience, for my love ñ Claw my flesh, oh, claw my flesh ñ I offer my left hand ñ I swear devotion ñ By these numbers ñ 666
Looking dark times in the face ñ I find hope in your arms ñ Based upon more than a feeling ñ Can you taste my confusion ñ If you want to run away from me ñ Fear can be an ugly thing ñ You may fire when ready ñ Sometimes i get so depressed ñ And you don't know what it's like ñ I refuse to show you the way
Someone danced before the stage ñ 3 pints since they ran out of range ñ They know that a home ñ Is another word for being alone ñ They don't want to leave us yet ñ Give them one more tune they ñ Can forget ñ Closing time is near ñ There is a hole in our hearts ñ Big enough to hide an angel ñ If you're down at the bottom ñ The only exit is above ñ And if you break through the sky ñ Without caught up your own angel ñ I've heard somebody find them ñ On the grass of Eden's lawn
Bold hunters all fall down ñ Hunting, hunting ñ This is the hunting ground ñ Hunting, hunting ñ Sold out so go home ñ Nirvana on display ñ Hunting, hunting ñ Gives back to take away ñ Hunting, hunting ñ Sold out so go home ñ No form of any kind ñ Hunting, hunting ñ There's no more left to find ñ Hunting, hunting ñ Sold out so go home ñ Survivors disappear ñ Hunting, hunting ñ So now the coast is clear ñ Hunting, hunting ñ Sold out so go home
Don't cry ñ (You sing it and I'll show you how my voice has made it unbelievable, baby...) ñ (Okay, George) ñ Alright ñ I can't stand to see you cry ñ I can't stand to see you cry ñ If tears.. ñ I can't stand to see you cry, no baby no ñ I can't stand to see you cry
Sodomize thru the night - who has killed the fucking light ñ What the fuck do you expect to see ñ When Jesus lying naked in front of me ñ  ñ Goat in pain - the satanic reign ñ Who has killed the fucking light ñ Who has killed the fucking light, huh ? ñ You are all doomed to misery ñ So fuck some goatcorpses in praise of me
It's not your fault ñ It's my own fault ñ I'm not human at all ñ I have no heart ñ It's not my fault ñ It's your own fault ñ I'm not human at all ñ I have no heart ñ  ñ It's not your fault ñ It's my own fault ñ I'm not human at all ñ I have no heart ñ It's not your fault ñ It's my own fault ñ I'm not human at all ñ I have no heart ñ  ñ We're not human at all ñ We have no heart
Guess who died, last night ñ In grey stockings, in all might ñ It was no loss ñ The only God of mine ñ He fell down, just to drown ñ In a sea of delight ñ To tame champagne ñ And creatures of the night ñ As the water took him over ñ Filled his lungs inside out ñ I sold his gold ñ For flowers and rice ñ Speaking fire, he would hire ñ Pawns and peasants just like me ñ To feed upon the conquered ones ñ But now we are free
Too many times away from home ñ The days is lonely the night time gone ñ I'm missing you baby I'm missing you baby ñ I love you so good I need you so bad ñ I hate to leave you I got to go ñ Friend I don't have to leave you no more ñ I'm missing you baby I'm missing you baby ñ I love you so good I need you so bad ñ I'm going to send you a letter as soon as I can ñ To stop all your worrying to where I am ñ I'm missing you baby I'm missing you baby ñ I love you so good I need you so bad
Remember me, I'm the one that's back from over ñ Time's gone by and I'm still so far from over ñ You reappeared like you had never been gone ñ I lose composure ñ You're touching me like you have no desire for closure ñ Reconsider ñ  ñ Did you lie awake like I did? ñ I stayed up til the stars didn't recognise me ñ So long ñ I waited so long ñ Now you don't see the skies that I do ñ My sun becomes your moon ñ For a familiar love ñ I am familiar
Life and means to make noise that's core ñ Anarchist ideals nihilistic grind core!
Lyrics from Snippets ñ She taking a bitch out, my motor is still flexing ñ I have something to say about love, we came together from the stars above ñ Make time ñ I'm calling you from out the way, I want to feel your face ñ When down and out, I miss your taste, I miss your taste ñ All I wanna do is get you in my space ñ You always with your friends, till I make that call I'm coming over ñ Coming strong, coming...

Portraits of a miracle ñ Portraits torn in stripes ñ White sparks surround the fly ñ When it's longing for stars ñ Laughter in the trees ñ Laughter lift the curtain ñ Spiders haunt the fly ñ When it's singing its song ñ Cheer up!

Howls the fly ñ When it moves its legs

The star drew nigh to the north west, on Bethlehem it took its' rest. And there it did both stop and stay right over the place where Jesus lay

Could this be a melody? ñ Dissolved from the ground ñ I don't know the things you said ñ I cut 'em out of my head ñ  ñ Could this be the jealousy? ñ Of the week I started to mess up ñ I was searching for you ñ But it was in the dark at night of the blue
Chill me babe, chill me babe ñ Make me feel all right, make me feel all right ñ Ya make me feel so good, ya feel so good, make me feel all right ñ I'm a man of stone, I built of stone ñ I have water running through my bones, I'm a man of stone ñ I'm a man of stone ñ I'm a man of stone ñ I'm a man of stone
Sleeping when the day breaks ñ Dreaming as the evening falls ñ He's got no more headaches ñ Leaving us with empty walls ñ The last of many efforts ñ I know it's not my place ñ But I don't even wonder why ñ What commitment ñ What grace ñ To just refuse to be alive

Let there be you ñ Let there be me ñ Let there be oysters ñ Under the sea ñ Let there be wind ñ An occasional rain ñ Chile con carne ñ Sparkling champagne ñ Let there be birds ñ To sing in the trees ñ Someone to bless me ñ Whenever I sneeze ñ Let there be cuckoos ñ A lark and a dove ñ But first of all, please ñ Let there be love ñ Let there be cuckoos ñ A lark and a dove ñ But first of all, please ñ Let there be love ñ Love ñ Love ñ Let there be love
Nothing ever happened since Brunkeflo ñ My life is really boring, so are you ñ My real and only pleasure is the sit in the loo ñ Counting flies all I do
All alone or in twos ñ The ones who really love you ñ Walk up and down ñ Outside the Wall ñ Some hand-in-hand ñ And some gathered together in bands ñ The bleeding hearts and artists make their stand ñ And when they've given you their all ñ Some stagger and fall, after all, it's not easy ñ Banging your heart against some mad bugger's Wall
Yeah this next joint right here ñ Is dedicated to all my niggas that I love ñ All the niggas that held it down with me through the whole shit ñ From the beginning of the fort, to the now current day of the fort ñ From the beginning and the birth of this whole shit ñ To the now success of this whole shit ñ And all my peoples that be holdin' it down for their peoples ñ Ridin' with them ñ  ñ Why ñ Why ñ Come on back ñ Sugar, sugar ñ Why ñ Over you ñ Why ñ Won't you come on back ñ Why don't you come on back
I love sleeping, I love eating ñ When it is boring, I love to fight ñ Anger, confusion, illusion, bullshit ñ Charmed the woman, drank the whisky ñ Just made history ñ Bullshit ñ I love you now
I wanna live i wanna hang way up in a tree ñ I'll describe all the things that i see ñ World stretching out around me ñ Mountains meet land ñ Go meet the seed ñ Ba-ba-ba...
Oooooooooooo ñ Oooooooooooo ñ Oooooooooooo ñ Oh, come on - mmm ñ Now I wanna - smoke marijiuna ñ Now I wanna - smoke marijiuna ñ Now I wanna - smoke marijiuna ñ Fake club soda - extra free ñ Just got to pour - keep up for me ñ Fake club soda - extra free ñ Just got to pour - keep up for me
Here I am with my heart wide open ñ I'm holding fast ñ To the words that You've spoken ñ Teach me Your ways Lord ñ You are my portion ñ You are my passion ñ Turn my heart away ñ From any selfish gain ñ Turn my eyes away ñ From every worthless thing ñ I set my heart on You ñ For only You can make this life brand new ñ I will run to You, hide Your words in me ñ Only You can set this prisoner free ñ Set me free
The magic in my heart is dead ñ The magic - it's...it's dead ñ The magic in my heart is dead, is dead ñ The magic, which in hearts, is dead, dead ñ Magic, magic in my heart is dead, is dead ñ The ma...the ma... ñ The hearts ñ Is dead, is dead ñ The magic, magic ñ Dead (is dead, is dead)

Taken ñ My limitations ñ To enable ñ All my temptations ñ Unchained ñ From my creation ñ Nothing precious ñ Without fixation ñ  ñ Deny ñ Kept in chains ñ Fly ñ Run away ñ  ñ Leashes leaving me conscious ñ While I'm searching ñ In the distance ñ Focus ñ Keeping me captive ñ So I don't get lost ñ With chains on my back ñ I fly ñ  ñ Deny ñ Kept in chains ñ Fly ñ Run away ñ  ñ Deny ñ Kept in chains ñ Fly ñ Run away
The hands of God were bigger than grandpa's eyes ñ But still he broke the elastic on your waist ñ  ñ But he'll never break you, baby ñ But he'll never break you, baby ñ  ñ The hands of God were bigger than grandpa's eyes ñ But he's long gone ñ  ñ The love you feel is strong ñ The love you feel is stronger ñ  ñ I will take the dark part ñ Of your heart into my heart ñ I will take the dark part ñ Of your heart into my heart
I should care ñ I should go around weepin' ñ I should care ñ I should go without sleepin' ñ Strangely enough, I sleep well ñ Except for a dream or two ñ But, then I count my sheep well ñ Funny how sheep can lull you to sleep ñ Man, I, I should care ñ I should let it upset me ñ Ooh, I should care ñ But it just doesn't get me ñ Maybe I won't find someone as lovely as you ñ But I, I should care and I do ñ Maybe I won't find someone as lovely as you ñ But I, I should care ñ I should care, and, yes, I do ñ Yes, I do
Girl, I feel, so slightly alien ñ How, unreal, and such a waste its been ñ Now, you feel, so far away from me ñ Help me get out over the sea ñ Girl, I dream, so slightly alien ñ How, serene, how far away I've been ñ Now, you seem, so slightly alien
This how we do it on Staten ñ We hardly get caught with our hoodies off, let alone a ratchet
Bleed - You are bleeding to death ñ But from the outside you look so good ñ And inside you've rotted away ñ And you won't know until that day ñ When we have drained you ñ It will be too late ñ To save your skin ñ And alter your face ñ And a little time is all that we need ñ And now we are watching you bleed...
Pelt and chime the beauty of synchronicity ñ Stand still for not a single second ñ Shimmer and wave, destroy your home ñ Stand still for not a single second ñ In beauty lies compensation ñ Sharpening his bundle of sticks into arrows laced with impulse ñ A skim over cupid's diary sickened by each entry ñ Ink to blood, paper to flesh ñ And I am suspended in mid-air, frozen by intuition ñ Pelt and chime ñ Well rehearsed chaos gives me something to hum to
Yet I reach the awakening and if I am smiling sarcasm is spreading from my deepest soul ñ Endlessness the being for sure is...
When you walk through a storm ñ Hold your head up high ñ And don't be afraid of the dark ; ñ At the end of the storm there is a golden sky ñ And the sweet silver song of the lark ñ Walk on through the wind ñ Walk on through the rain ñ Tho' your dreams be tossed and blown ñ Walk on, walk on with hope in your heart ñ And you'll never walk alone ñ You'll never walk alone ñ Walk on, walk on with hope in your heart ñ And you'll never walk alone ñ You'll never walk alone
I could have hoped for a better piece of your man. Better times I wrote for glass, less, wind ñ From both behinds in back, we're reaching one of each, in time. Heart like a picture to be ñ Hardly, we reach
: ñ Hey, little darling, oh, little darling ñ Oh, where are you? ñ My love, I was wrong to try to love two ñ Know well that my love ñ Was just for you, oh, only you ñ : ñ My darling, I need you to call my own and never do wrong, ñ To hold in mine your little hand. ñ I'll know too soon that all is so grand. Please, hold my hand. ñ : ñ My dear, I was wrong ñ To try to love two ñ Know well that my love was just for you, oh only you
The leaves of brown ñ Came tumblin' down, remember ñ In September in the rain ñ The sun went out ñ Just like a dying ember ñ That September in the rain ñ To every word of love ñ I heard you whisper ñ The raindrops seemed to play ñ A sweet refrain ñ Though spring is here ñ To me it's still September ñ That September in the rain ñ To every word of love ñ I heard you whisper ñ The raindrops seemed to play ñ A sweet refrain ñ Though spring is here ñ To me it's still September ñ That September in the rain ñ That September in the rain
Time passes like a little cloud, my friend ñ But don't be cowed, my friend ñ Just stay positive ñ That's the thing, right? ñ (Right!) ñ I'll try to remember not to be sucky-like ñ But I'll be more plucky, like the birdies who sing ñ Tra-la! ñ (Ch-ch-ch-chee-chee-cheep cheep-cheep) ñ Tra-la! ñ (Ch-ch-ch-chee-chee-cheep cheep-cheep) ñ Tra-la! ñ (Chee-chee-chee-cheep cheep-cheep) ñ Tra-laaaa!

When I was lost ñ You paid the cost ñ  ñ You ransomed me ñ Your Spirit to impart ñ Gave me love ñ And refreshed my weary heart ñ  ñ You are always with me ñ There is none beside You ñ Now I'm closer than I've ever been ñ  ñ  ñ When I was lost ñ You paid the cost

I won't sing, I won't shout if you throw me out ñ I'll just go on my way with nothing to say ñ But its not gonna 'appen, and no, it won't 'appen ñ I won't let it 'appen agen ñ You say you lie an' you say that you might ñ Let me return to stay aroun' with you ñ But it's not gonna 'appen and no it won't 'appen ñ Oh I won't let it 'appen agen oh no, no no ñ I try hard to like you and that's all I can do ñ Let me return to stay aroun' with you ñ But its...
I've been thinking many things today ñ Manipulating ñ I've been sitting, sitting, thinking ñ All yours ñ Unpleasant soul ñ Let's not sell it out ñ Let's not sell it out ñ Let's not sell it out ñ I don't want to sell it to you ñ I don't want to sell it to you ñ I've been thinking of your face today ñ Intimidating ñ I've been wishing for a way to hold ñ Your ugly heart ñ Let's not sell it out ñ Let's not sell it out ñ Let's not sell it out ñ I don't want to sell it to you ñ I don't want to sell it to you
I know this love is kinda crazy ñ But baby it's much more than lust ñ Without you by my side, I'm dazy ñ All I can think about is us ñ The streets I wander just to picture ñ Moments and dreams I shared with you ñ Although new flowers will be blooming ñ Without you by my side, I'm blue ñ  ñ Oh how I want you ñ You make me feel ñ You make me feel ñ You make me feel ñ You make me feel ñ  ñ Stay...
I woke face down in the sand ñ Only remembering the holes in your hands ñ You looked at me so fondly ñ Although I walked away ñ So can you teach me to dance ñ Or tell me the number of stars in the sky? ñ I am a carcass lying in the roses ñ Suffocating with each breath ñ Turning the pedals into paper ñ I'll kill us all before I'm through ñ Pull out my heart; ñ Tear at my lungs so I don't feel this anymore
Collections could never understand ñ Beds of rot, they never can be down ñ Maybe I got problems ñ Maybe I don't but it's not for you to say ñ Oh, I got my heart inside a loom ñ Pulled apart and tearing over soon ñ Maybe this is progress ñ Maybe it's not but it's not for you to say ñ Maybe I got problems ñ Maybe I don't but it's not for you to say ñ Hit me with the old believing saint ñ Fell apart because of his mistake ñ Maybe I got problems ñ Maybe I don't too ñ Maybe this is progress ñ Maybe it's not but I don't need you
I don't believe ñ I don't believe it's true ñ I walk right in ñ I don't believe it's true ñ But you cannot stop it ñ Cannot stop this now
I know there's nothing in there ñ But i don't care ñ I am your holy father ñ Don't be scared ñ Above that dying kingdom ñ I am there ñ I will tear your heart out ñ Don't be scared ñ You will live forever ñ So dry your eyes ñ Or i will drink your tears ñ And make them mine ñ Oh god ñ I am your soul ñ Oh darling ñ What have you done

Lately I find myself out gazing at stars ñ Hearing guitars like someone in love ñ Sometimes the things I do astound me ñ Mostly whenever you're around me ñ Lately I seem to walk as though I have wings ñ And to sing like someone in love ñ Each time I look at you I'm limp as a glove ñ And feeling like someone in love
(x2) ñ I used, I used her right (x3) ñ Oh, yeah ñ (x2) ñ Don't you give me no ñ Don't you give me no shit ñ  ñ I used, I used her right (x3) ñ Oh, yeah ñ I broke her open wide (x3) ñ Oh, yeah ñ (x2) ñ  ñ I used, I used her right (x2) ñ Oh, yeah ñ  ñ Digging down, down deep in my conscience ñ Digging up something nasty and white ñ Break wide down, down the middle and hard ñ I'll tear away what I came for
Where even angels fear to fly ñ Beyond the clouds you and I
In the city where the lights are pretty ñ And the girls dance in the night ñ In the city, there's a dark, dark house ñ Where no one dares to go ñ Oh, oh ñ Oh, oh ñ Oh, oh ñ Oh, oh ñ Oh, oh ñ Oh, oh ñ Oh, oh ñ Oh, oh
If you're lost at sea ñ Will you wait for me ñ If i'm shot down ñ Will you look for me ñ If i'm locked out ñ Will you let me in ñ Now i can't get out ñ I forgot how ñ Held all the doors open ñ Held all the doors open ñ If i'm lost at sea ñ Will you let me be ñ If you can't find ñ Any reason ñ Any reason to stay alive ñ I'll let you go ñ I'll let you go ñ If you can't find ñ If you can't find ñ If you can't find ñ Any reason ñ Any reason to stay alive ñ I'll let you go
I'm gonna try to make you mine ñ I said I'm gonna try to make you mine ñ Oh yeah I'm gonna try to make you mine ñ Right now I'm gonna try to make you mine ñ When I get that feelin' inside ñ My heart starts jumpin' it's electrified ñ Maybe baby, maybe this time ñ Make you mine ñ I'd break down and cry to ñ Make you mine ñ I'd lay down and die to ñ Make you mine
What does it mean ñ To be a snake ñ What does it mean ñ To be a politician ñ I've only got the best intentions ñ But that's not all it takes ñ 'Cause I am snakes ñ And I am working for the good of us ñ But that requires a little trust ñ And who can trust ñ Who can trust ñ A snake?
I could see the other end ñ Repeat as necessary ñ A beam shown divided shaded over screens ñ In the presence of visuals ñ Covered and drawn in ñ Watched its repetition siphoning ñ In the corners locusts rotating ñ Empty me feeding ñ Conceived the believing ñ As parted or programmed ñ Plans of obsolescence inhaled again ñ Do you see its face? ñ Or the masters orders ñ They consumed the maker over again ñ In the corners locusts rotating ñ Empty me feeding

A sea of goods just await to escape, into the hands of those who pillage and rape ñ Throw the sails upon the wind and bury the treasure for the next of kin.

The blues don't care, who's got 'em ñ The blues don't care, who cries ñ And the nights don't care who's lonely ñ Or whose tears are in whose eyes ñ When someones heart is broken ñ The blues are not to blame ñ 'Cause the blues don't care who's got 'em ñ So they just added my name ñ And the nights don't care who's lonely ñ Or whose tears are in whose eyes ñ When someones heart is broken ñ The blues are not to blame ñ 'Cause the blues don't care who's got 'em ñ So they just added my name

Writings found beneath the stairs ñ Where youth dares to crawl ñ Gasps and murmurs, muffled shrills ñ Phantoms trape the halls ñ The ushering, ushering in of the magical era ñ Statues of your ancestors ñ Speech in whispered tones ñ As Houdini reappears ñ To unmask a form ñ Magical, magical ñ Oh oh ñ Magical, magical
Psssssht! ñ As you look out the window ñ Look by the road ñ Y'all might see ñ Model T Ford ñ As you look out the window ñ Look by the road ñ Y'all might see ñ Model T Ford ñ  station now

Red squirrel in the morning ñ Red squirrel in the evening ñ Red squirrel in the morning ñ I'm coming to take you home ñ  ñ Sun risin' over my head ñ In the morning when I rise ñ Hold me dear into the night ñ Sun, it will rise soon enough ñ  ñ The sun rising, dangling there ñ Golden and fair, in the sky
Let there be you ñ Let there be me ñ Let there be oysters ñ Under the sea ñ Let there be wind ñ An occassional rain ñ Chile con carne ñ Sparkling champagne -- ñ Let there be birds ñ To sing in the trees ñ Someone to bless me ñ Whenever I sneeze ñ Let there be cuckoos ñ A lark and a dove ñ But first of all, please -- ñ Let there be love ñ ~interlude~ ñ Let there be cuckoos ñ A lark and a dove ñ But first of all, please -- ñ Let there be love... ñ Hmmm umm...love ñ Hmmm umm...love ñ Let there be love
I feel a warm resistance ñ Beneath the outer layer ñ What once moved living organs ñ Leaks through a thin veneer ñ Blue blooded royal body ñ Elegantly posed to death ñ Not speaking prince now are you? ñ Not breathing one more breath ñ Just now the curtain's folding ñ It falls and lies to rest ñ So selfish royal brother ñ You've loved your wife to death ñ Your ways could not continue ñ You'd rule with hateful hands ñ I called you toward the staircase ñ And I caused your violent end
Times running out the candle only burns so bright times running out ñ It's up for you to blind the world & shine till you blind the world ñ Show how, how much you need me & I need you ñ Together we'll reach our goals through each other ñ Quit searching for the answers ñ MAKE YOUR OWN FUCKING MEANING OF LIFE ñ Times running out

Bring me down to where you sleep ñ Soothe me now, sing with my screams ñ Touch me now while I cant see ñ At least half your life is wrapped in peace ñ Dream warm me with chemistry, your chemistry ñ Shes warming, Its alright, Its alright ñ Theres more in you ñ Warm me, Its alright now, The wonder of you ñ The chemistry, Your chemistry ñ Dream warm me ñ With chemistry, your chemistry ñ She watches me ñ She watches me ñ More than the eyes inside
Buried in your narrow house, six feet under ñ Rest In Peace, the mourners, heartfelt wish ñ But there is no god above you, only the worms below ñ And when your casket rots, they squirm forth ñ Upon your putrefacted flesh the worms do feast ñ Creeping through your brains, they eat your spent hopes ñ Crawling through your heart, they eat your secret loves ñ The worms swallow all that you were, and will ever be ñ Worship the Worm as it consumes your Eternity ñ Worship the Worm as it conquers your Humanity
Nice mint, lemon berry tint ñ Pulled up two times on some Siamese twins ñ Copped the Fitzgerald in the red Ranger ñ Diamonds dancing on my finger, Macarena (damn) ñ Might be balling, jumping out the gym ñ Me and Harmony Korine in a hologram Benz ñ I can steal cookies from your daughter's lunch ñ Red rubies on my chain look like Hawaiian Punch

I think she loves you ñ Three don't worry the one ñ Oh, darling, I will go to see Ottolenghi and eat orange peel ñ Get there early and get real good seats ñ Hum to the earth that's under your feet ñ Five down for a four letter word for a knife ñ I told you the pills he gave did no good ñ I went for a ring then a small jet to blue ñ The sun didn't show it's face for a year or two ñ Maybe he is a phantom, so's she ñ That singer, he made a mistake he didn't see ñ Now the old circle's broken round the old Irish tree

Human filth in the gasoline spill ñ Riding hard to perdition ñ Rock and roll on the ground ñ Squeeze tighter and down ñ And sink into my illusion ñ I got a superbuick ñ I'm on the highway ñ I got a superbuick ñ I'm on the highway ñ I've been riding for so long ñ Headlights and the radio on ñ Look inside my seat ñ It's the same old treat ñ I think it's always the nod this time ñ Pull into the station ñ Hands shake with anticipation ñ Look inside my hell ñ In its porcelain shell ñ They all look the same this time
An easterly breeze can pass along tears ñ A passage make her anxious to leave ñ And ask of run line ñ We're making good time ñ We'll make and far by dawn ñ Oh aren't you glad you came along ñ  ñ Sail me away to Bimini Bay ñ Oh Oh oo Oh Oh oo Oh ñ Sail me away to Bimini Bay ñ Oh Oh oo Oh Oh oo Oh ñ Sail me away to Bimini Bay ñ Oh Oh oo Oh Oh oo Oh ñ  ñ We've been gone oh so very long ñ That we've forgotten where we are from ñ We've been gone for so very long ñ That we've forgotten where we are from
I thought maybe I'd find a friend ñ Or maybe I'd meet a girl ñ Have a great conversation with a stranger ñ On the other side of the world ñ Or maybe learn something new ñ About a culture or a place ñ Connect with another human being ñ But every time I press new game ñ All I see is ñ Guys jerking off ñ Guys jerking off ñ Just penises and cocks ñ And guys jerking them off ñ Hold on ñ This guy's not jerking off ñ Maybe he's like me ñ And he just wants to talk ñ Hi, how are you? ñ "Nope, there he goes ñ Uh, dude, that is a lot of cum"
Come on girl, tell me something ñ Tell me something I don't know ñ Little girl, should I be scared the way I am? ñ Does it feel OK to stand so close to me? ñ Take my hand, try to walk in time together ñ I'm doubting it could ever be that real ñ Can't be sure, cannot rest inside worlds ñ Either one could change tomorrow ñ Then they'd see that none bear hurt ñ It isn't fair; it can't be worth the pain ñ Last time together ñ Only falling deep inside yourself again
Decide nothing ñ I depend for everything ñ You don't need me ñ You don't need anything ñ Remedies were bankrupt like the rest of these ñ Forget what they told you - there's no self-help ñ Taken by Your glory - don't look back now ñ I don't care who I am, I lost that interest ñ There are no mirrors deep enough to meet my needs

Once there was a man of many means ñ Inherited from someone else's dreams ñ He said one day I'll plough and sow the seeds ñ If only I could learn to tame the weeds ñ And every time I get to the end ñ I'll turn round and start again ñ I'll keep coming back ñ I'll make it on my own ñ I'll make it on my own ñ 'Cause it's what I was made for ñ I just can't wait any longer ñ My heart won't beat any stronger ñ This life was meant for me

So I once rode ñ With sword and shield ñ The path of my fate ñ Destiny ñ Upwards the rock of eternity ñ With a countenance ñ Stiff from pain ñ The summit seems far ñ Yet is it ñ No severe ride ñ The weaker I get, the louder my end's ñ Shouts grow ñ The brave nag trotting ñ Leads me ñ Of this life, but ñ Where then to? ñ The blood we let, makes our path ñ Divine
As soft as the gentle rising dew ñ As mellow as the warm morning sun ñ But love to her wasn't a serious game ñ Just a new face and another name ñ  ñ A flower of summer, long golden hair ñ Sudden summerstorm, playing so unfair ñ To her I was a pawn in her winning game ñ Just a new face and another name ñ  ñ Woman of the world, taking what you can ñ No one could ever hold you moving on ñ Woman of the world, with another man ñ No one could ever hold you down

Hands in the dark ñ Touch and depart ñ Fingers probe and return to the glove ñ And fall away across the floor ñ Leading left from right

The day you said we'd never part ñ You turned around and broke my heart ñ You had the nerve to tell me I would soon forget ñ Now you've been gone away one year ñ And I have not forgotten, dear ñ The love I had for you so long ñ Is still here ñ Wow-oh ñ  ñ It's here, still here ñ Because my heart cannot believe ñ We're really through ñ And though you said we'd never part ñ You turned around and broke my heart ñ The love I had for you so long ñ Is still here ñ  
And I'll leave you all ñ With your playthings all arranged ñ In a rage for you to live with ñ Well it gets so rough ñ Acting like a sworn enemy ñ And it gets so rough ñ Even if it is the best I gave ñ What is love without pain ñ Holy rollers pictures of ñ The hounds of nothing ñ She will catch you without falling ñ Well it gets so rough ñ Acting like a sworn enemy ñ And it gets so rough ñ Even if it is the best I gave ñ What is love without pain
What if you could meet your maker? ñ What would you have to say? ñ Who am I? Who are they? Where'd we come from? ñ What's beyond the milky way? ñ Are we the only ones? ñ Is this real life or fantasy? ñ Is there a god behind the sun? ñ Well it's not plain to see ñ Every night I go to bed with my headset on ñ Transmitted tones to alien frequency ñ Frost-bitten world has turned me off ñ So I keep turned on ñ Listening for signs of alien frequency
Will I feel this way tomorrow ñ This happiness can't wait for hours ñ Will it all be gone tomorrow ñ Am I wrong to try hold to this power ñ Don't want the date to change tomorrow ñ Here's your calendar I borrowed ñ Just won't be the same tomorrow ñ Can I get today just one more hour ñ One hour just for me and all my friends? ñ I will find a way to do what I set out to ñ Spending all my time just thinking ñ I will find a way just for us today ñ The possibility that I've done it now
She's mine, you know she does me good, yeah ñ She's mine, takes me in and gives me food, all right ñ But she knows it's understood, we've gotta be alone, all right, lady ñ She's mine, she's good for my head, yeah ñ She wraps me up tight and puts me into bed, yeah ñ She lays me down, she lays me down and knocks me dead, oh left me in my base ñ She's mine, does me good ñ She's mine, takes me for bed ñ She knows it's understood and we've gotta be alone ñ Yeah it's understood, yeah I've got to be alone
I don't care what you do ñ As long as you do it to me ñ Cause I'm in love with you ñ Jewelry lasts forever ñ So does a love letter ñ But sometimes that seems wrong ñ So maybe I'll write you a 3 minute song ñ Or maybe we'll eat a 30 second donut ñ Or maybe you'll make me laugh for a moment ñ But it doesn't really matter how much time ñ Goes by ñ Cause nothing really matters since Zennie died ñ It's all I can do to keep the Zen alive ñ When I've got you on my mind ñ I don't think about time
Some girls say all they need is dreaming ñ But some girls say they ain't got time ñ But for those who dream ñ Well they just keep dreaming ñ We've got to chase the dream to be happy ñ Do you wanna sail into the sky? ñ Soar across the stars? ñ Well, I knew a girl, and her name was Lily ñ But her Daddy called her something rather silly ñ He called her by a name which matched her art ñ Come on and fly with me, fly with me ñ My little Airheart
This is a fight, broken bottles, bloody walls ñ There was a time when a fist could solve it all ñ But those days are gone along with many murdered lives ñ  ñ Hey, contention ñ Hey, it's killing us ñ  ñ This is a war, complete with a body count ñ This ain't the past, this ain't the future, this is now ñ When will we stand up and refuse to be put down? ñ  ñ Hey, contention ñ Hey, it's killing us
Look ñ In the cut like a barber ñ I stay in yo bitch like a wall to a charger
I strapped my memories to my back ñ I'm leaving ñ I'm already gone ñ And i was on a train somewhere wishing sweet stings to you ñ To make you never forget the poetry in wanting ñ I want those days to hold you
Justification is like a womb ñ In which your social form of normality ñ Has been fucked so many times ñ Showing us asbolute no mercy ñ Towards putting the salt into the wounds ñ We are the true meaning of evil demise ñ Crowned with Supremacy ñ We bid you farewell ñ Because now you are the ones who shall be ñ Victimized
Washing hair and deep down, and disappear ñ Flipping off planes from the ground ñ Expensive sex ñ My self esteem ñ If I, If I should lose my life ñ If If, I should lose all right, all right all right ñ And your decent in the middle smoking belittled ñ You're so nervous, it makes me nervous ñ If I should lose my life
Pride comes first ñ I've heard ñ But I can't see how ñ Wait oh wait ñ Uh huh ñ You can't see ñ How
You know you've taken my woman, just  ñ You've taken my woman,  ñ 'Wonder, why did you do it? I always tried to be your friend ñ Don't forget, you've got to reap just what you sow ñ Please don't forget, you've got to reap just what you sow ñ You know you've taken my woman, just , oh! ñ Please don't forget, you've got to reap just what you sow ñ Please don't forget, you've got to reap just what you sow ñ Well you can't do wrong and  all the time

Girl I ain't into breaking up happy homes ñ Most guys don't know what they really want ñ Its true ñ What I'm saying girl's real ain't no silicone ñ You're better off leaving your man at home ñ He's no goo-ood
Rain is coming down ñ And that is when the feeling comes ñ Rain-Rain is coming down ñ And all my wounds are bleeding out ñ Blue-Blue out of the sky ñ A perfect hue to say goodbye ñ You-You can only try ñ To take the reigns by fate decides ñ I'll be hoping ñ You can give back when I've given you ñ I can see the truth ñ You give back what I've given you ñ White below ñ White below
Happy but for awhile ñ The good times were out of style ñ And April came and went ñ And colder than it's ever been ñ You'd lay in the morning time ñ And gaze at the ceiling, tired and low ñ And lately you can hear the rain ñ Blowing against your windowpane ñ Sounding like a marching drum ñ Rolled in for a firing gun ñ It once used to bring you down ñ But now doesn't turn you 'round, you go, you go ñ And you won't remember when ñ You'd hide and the howling wind would blow, would blow
Witness ñ Civil oppression ñ Oh lord ñ Witness ñ Civil oppression ñ (hey mother f**keraEUR|hey don't)
6 billion people on this earth can't all be wrong ñ We've been blind to their advances ñ We're way to busy stroking egos and building bombs ñ Awaiting second chances ñ 6 billion people on this earth can't all deserve to die, die
Run into the darkness of the trees ñ Only there you will not be found ñ Flee in to the light of the burning sand ñ Only there you will not be seen ñ They will try to follow you ñ Just like they followed those before ñ A bastardized culture of inbred fucks ñ They aren't going very far

Lingering strong is my dream of greatness ñ A history that had its day, came and went ñ Broken bones and broken hearts will make it true ñ All that left is here again and the rest's arriving soon ñ With trembling hands I raised it up for all to see ñ Just what we'd done towards a new breed ñ Wretched dreams and endless schemes ñ I need a miracle, we need a miracle ñ A purity that's bound to dwindle ñ A poor attempt to rekindle what was lost
Love you so, love you so, love you so ñ Why it is, I don't know, I don't know ñ All I know is when I look in your eyes ñ I realize I love you so ñ I'm alone, all alone, so alone ñ Why must I sit and cry, all alone ñ Crying for your arms, your kisses, your fingers touch ñ Why must I love you oh so much ñ I'm alone, all alone, so alone ñ Why must I sit and cry all alone ñ Crying for your arms, your kisses, your fingers touch ñ Why must I love you so ñ Oh, so much
Alone ñ Even my thoughts are elsewhere ñ Drag me down, I'm drowning lazy ñ Unstuck in time like Billy Pilgrim ñ With the X-ray eyes of Edgar Cayce ñ And I show what you know ñ And I feel what you mean ñ So just let it go ñ I live and I grow older ñ Get weak as I grow stronger ñ And happiness, it seems to be ñ A different wind through familiar trees
Foggy road my visions blurred ñ Have i lost my sight of you? ñ Distractions rise to grab attention ñ I long to see this vision through (i give it up to you) ñ Please guide our steps so that we may follow ñ All i have: it's all yours ñ Step by step we'll see this through ñ The past behind us ñ Die to myself for something new ñ As i put my trust in you ñ I'm giving all. complete surrender ñ I long to see this vision through (i give it up to you) ñ Please guide our steps so that we may follow
Lyrics will be posted once the song is out!
"Would you die for him?" ñ "Yes!"
My momma told me ñ I was a child ñ She said, "Son ñ You're gonna have hard days" ñ My daddy told me too ñ He said, "Son ñ You're gonna have sad days ñ Lonely nights ñ Stand alone ñ Head hung down ñ Tears runnin' down" ñ Done got old ñ Sad days, lonely nights ñ Done overtaken me ñ Sometimes I set alone ñ I wonder about the things ñ My mum and daddy told me ñ Sad days, lonely nights ñ Come overtaking me
These are all words lost in dreams ñ Travelling the speed that blood pumps ñ I feel your breath which carries my hope ñ In the way ships pass at night ñ Making the hands a world map ñ Every word announces storms ñ It's like stepping from the door ñ There is no barrier and no wall ñ In the way ships pass at night ñ Endless looping chains of rooms ñ Go forever, hurry you're... ñ  ñ Looping streetlights spell out words ñ I don't want to say goodbye ñ But as I wake it begins to lose sense
Be my daddy ñ Be my mom ñ I want to be what you've become ñ Yes ñ No ñ Maybe so ñ I've seen them once, I've seen them all ñ Nowhere! Nowhere! ñ Nowhere! Nowhere! ñ  ñ Be my daddy ñ Be my
My boat moved out to sea ñ And friends grew small from me ñ Waving from the shore ñ Will I see you more? ñ The land is misty, my eyes are too ñ The gulls are crying for me and you ñ And now the sea is all around ñ But still above the seabirds sound ñ Gliding round the stern ñ When we land will they return? ñ The land is misty, my eyes are too ñ The gulls are crying for me and you ñ My boat moved out to sea ñ And friends grew small from me ñ Waving from the shore ñ Will I see you more?
Curious to the taste ñ Oblivious to the take ñ A thinking mans mistake ñ Then you're far away ñ I had a grand old time ñ With these good friends of mine ñ A golden light did shine ñ And the world did sing ñ Burn slow (Burn Slow) ñ Burn slow ñ Burn slow (Burn slow) ñ Burn slow ñ I've had to pass the hat around ñ Drink some black water down ñ In a great walled lonely town ñ Full of ghosts and clouds ñ Had to keep the dogs at bay ñ Heard 'em howling every day ñ 'nough to drive a man insane ñ So I stayed a boy
The universe is taking my jacket ñ And never explaining ñ Why ñ The universe is singing, painting ñ 1574539 ñ Why ñ Below the sky ñ Is fine ñ But below the sea ñ Why ñ Your kiss is a home ñ My lips do not care ñ Why ñ The universe is my source ñ Amusing, I reciprocate ñ Why ñ Destruction ñ Immeasurable ñ And seemingly pointless ñ Why ñ Confused, bewildered, ambivalent ñ Somebody explain ñ Cloud whispers cloud wars ñ Angels are truth ñ Angels are a threat ñ To others ñ Why ñ The universe keeps taking my jacket ñ No need in explaining
I am the same ñ Except for everything ñ I am the same ñ Except for what i bring ñ I'll play your game ñ You ask me what's my name ñ It's all the same ñ When i am flying ñ Now i've lost my ground ñ And i'll hear the sound ñ Of something dying ñ Prince of valium i am ñ I am what i am i say ñ I am falling down
Yeah, oh yeah I'm on it ñ Oh ok ñ ... ñ Hello...?
I heed the late starlight ñ Between the stars and sky ñ Had to reach you, had to reach you ñ Had to reach you, had to reach you ñ  ñ La la la, la la-la, la la la, la la-la ñ La la la, la la-la, la la la, la la-la la ñ  ñ I heed the late starlight ñ Between the stars and sky ñ Had to reach you, had to reach you ñ Had to reach you, had to reach you
What is the date today? 27th of May, 1994
I made a start ñ Looked back just once ñ Rebels of the frontier ñ I can make it make sense ñ Defenders of the real ñ All I can see are dolphins ñ I feel close to them ñ And no one else ñ Road to nowhere ñ Point of no return ñ Stream of consciousness ñ He was just one ñ Like a prime number ñ He was devoid of plus ñ He looked up waited, so frustrated ñ I am vanishing into the trees ñ Defenders get onto your knees ñ Defenders get onto your knees
